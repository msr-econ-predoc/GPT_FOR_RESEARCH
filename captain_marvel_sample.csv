132155,Captain Marvel,2019-03-16,0,"If not for Iron Man 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 this would be the worst MCU movie ever made. Larson’s walk through of her lines\, the flat and very not funny one liners are only a few of the issues with this movie. My son and wife were so bored they took naps during the slower moving portions of the movie. I must say they were long naps. The action scenes served no purpose and the dramatic moments were lackluster at best. I wanted this movie to be good. I enjoyed all versions of Captain Marvel Comics but I can say this movie will not be added to my collection of MCU Blu-Rays. Disney has assumed the audience will flock to the movie regardless of the quality. Don’t be fooled this movie is at best a good in flight presentation as you fly across the country on Jet Blue",True
126956,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,0,"Half star\, does it mean that I’m threaten by empowered woman? “Neooow”! But GOD I’m so sick oh these movies bashing men\, why can’t they co exist simultaneously? This movie is the last Jedi of the MCU. Reviewers giving this lame movie 5 stars? Really? You mean this movie is on par with classic films with little room for improvement? No wonder the film industry is struggling to get people into the theaters. Speaking of that\, I reluctantly went to see this film with a couple of friends shortly after the movie opened and there were a total of five men and only one woman\, so I’m left scratching my head as to the millions of dollars it’s making reportedly? Fake news I guess. ",True
131464,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,3,I enjoyed many of the Marvel movies better than Cpt. Marvel.  Plot is elementary at best and action is average to sup par.,True
172902,Captain Marvel,2019-07-03,2,"The action scenes and the interaction between Captain Marvel and Nick Fury are really enjoyable. But the film doesn't really have a flare or style and feels kind of bland and boring. It's a movie. Not bad\, not great. Perfectly average.",True
160550,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,"one of the worst marvel movies ever seen\, i never found the climax in the movie.",True
198866,Captain Marvel,2019-12-16,0,Worst superhero movie ever,True
186190,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"This movie was AMAZING! This was NOT A FEMINIST MOVIE! It was an ALL-WOMEN EMPOWERING MOVIE!!!! And emotionally driven NOT over the top and PERFECTLY VISUSALLY STIMULATINGLY AND STUNNING. Every negative review is based on lack of PLAIN SENSE! This movie is everything a Marvel movie should be COMPLETE STORYLINE\, DRAMATICS\, THEATER AND FAMILY AND HOPE/ENCOURAGEMENT! Dont get distracted by egosticial driven people who dont want wmoem to LOOK OR BE ANYTHING THAN WHAT THEY IMAGINED. Those people need to slapped across the face with a bible maybe that will know some sense into them! It was amazing and Brie showed her authority and how much she wanted to be a part of something bigger than herself this IS COMPLETELY COMMENDABLE AND HONRABLE SO YOU GO BRIE LARSON....KICK ASS GIRL AND KEEP IT COMING!",True
114178,Captain Marvel,2019-03-29,1,.Couldn't connect with Carol at all!!!! It's a shame they ruined this character,True
112691,Captain Marvel,2019-04-14,4,Captian Marvel was a good fun Marvel film any Marvel fan would enjoy.,True
163446,Captain Marvel,2019-04-07,0,probably the worst Marvel movie since they started the whole cinematic universe. The character had a lot of potential but they blew it.,True
164218,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,Really enjoyed the movie. Another fun hit for Marvel.  Looking forward to more.,True
159776,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,5,"One of the best MCU movies \, totally in my top 7\, Carol Danvers is one of  most charismatic characters in this universe \, And the pair with Nick fury flawless",True
194240,Captain Marvel,2019-05-29,0,Weak and a pointless addition to the MCU ,True
196698,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,2,"While the highlight of the film was portrayed to be as a bubble of empowerment around Carol Danvers\, her character falls flat compared to side-characters.\n\nWhile the CG has always been something to appreciate\, the reliance on it can't save a film from a bad script. \n\nIf you want more marvel goodness\, go into this film with low expectations and watch out for the show stealing spotlight\, Goose the Cat.",True
190431,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,0,Two thumbs WAY the heck down,True
143699,Captain Marvel,2019-06-02,4,It's underrated due to audiences who can't let go of their ego's\nIt's an enjoyable movie with good humour and action,True
176901,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"The movie overall was okay\, not terrible\, nor the best movie. Captain marvel power were awesome made her completely unstoppable! And Goose and Nick Fury stole the movie\, but here the down side of the movie. The main protagonist is dull\, soft spoken\, and hard headed. Dramatically change a lot of stuff from the comics (which excepted). Focus more on political message standpoint than a superhero movie. More of a captain marvel and nick fury movie than her own. The most confusing part is how the portrayal the skrulls? If you want a good female-led role superhero Wonder Woman with Gal Gadot is FAR BETTER than this movie. Hopefully the Russo brother save her character in endgame.",True
158351,Captain Marvel,2019-03-17,2,"Not the worst Marvel movie\, but there was just to many slow points\, and I felt like it couldâ(TM)ve been better. The emphasis on the female role bled through to the supporting characters and even the music. There was only 1 song that wasnâ(TM)t by a woman. Iâ(TM)m all for equality\, but I felt like they were trying to make a point where there wasnâ(TM)t a need.",True
140602,Captain Marvel,2019-03-23,4,"I think it's a good movie. It is necessary to emphasize that the first minutes of the film the performance of the protagonist is not the best. But I think that in script and production is a very good movie. On the other hand\, some \""funny\"" or sound editing scenes were forced\, especially at the end of the movie.",True
148450,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,2,"Just nothing really amazing\, normal perfermance as a marvel movie\, but with very bad actor choice.",True
164778,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"Regardless of the nay sayers\, this was a solid origin story movie. I enjoyed the characters and look forward to more appearances of Cpt. Marvel.",True
142135,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,4,"It's a fun Marvel Pic. If you like comic book movies you won't be disappointed. Some of the reviews I've read are just plain ridiculous.  People just trying to how expansive their vocabulary is in an attempt to bring down this movie\, as if it's not like Citizen Kane it's not a good movie.  It only proves how obnoxious they are and it no way reflects upon the validity of whether this is a good movie. It is a good movie. Is it the best movie ever? No. But it doesn't have to be to be good or fun or worth seeing\, which it is all three.",True
107892,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,4,A wonderful origin story setting the stage for a new MCU legacy.,True
119635,Captain Marvel,2019-04-23,4,"Excellent set up film reminiscent the first outting of the big 3\, but with more experience\, barring some noticeable digi-doubles and a few unnecessary retcons\, this is a much watch for any action fan.",True
181663,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,"This is a GREAT\, GREAT movie. The whole theater burst into applause at the end. Whatever you do this weekend\, GO SEE IT and buy the soundtrack!",True
104572,Captain Marvel,2019-03-16,5,"A powerful\, visually stunning film demonstrating the perils of blindly believing in ones infallible morality. I left the theater feeling inspired and proud to be a woman\, despite the row of men behind me bad mouthing the film. Men - this film is not for you.",True
180912,Captain Marvel,2019-07-09,2,"This film has far too much focus on identity politics and not enough on the story. Many of the male characters were underused with Nick Fury\, one of the greatest Marvel characters ever\, in particular being used as a third-rate comic relief. ",True
106639,Captain Marvel,2019-06-15,3,"Average. Lot of flashbacks and story building but very light on action until the end. The acting was pretty good. I guess comparing it to other Marvel films\, this one fall short. Can't win 'em all.",True
141989,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,I tried to like it. Just wasn’t that great. I did not like Brie Larson in the role. She’s a good actress but not for this. ,True
101013,Captain Marvel,2019-04-04,5,"A little slow at first\, but overall great film. Humor was very likable and fighting scenes were amusing. ",True
164800,Captain Marvel,2019-07-15,0,"Relatively boring over done super hero movie\, with an unenthusiastic and drab lead actor.",True
166060,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,3,"Samuel l Jackson he Is the best in you character\,poor script and brie Is amazing but not all",True
112371,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"Captain Marvel is one of those in a long list\, 21\, of Marvel movies that seem to just fall flat. I would rate it somewhere around the second Thor movie which not great either. The dialogue came off flat and there seemed to be that emotional element that many audiences would relate to was left out. There was no pepper Potts for captain marvel.",True
178677,Captain Marvel,2019-03-17,2,There was no like no action,True
161213,Captain Marvel,2019-03-26,4,Overall a good film. The characters for the most part were good. The story although at times didn't make scene was good. The reverse aging effects on Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg were amazing. The cat was hilarious. Lastly The villeins although no ego or thanos were done well. Overall I liked it.,True
121122,Captain Marvel,2019-03-31,5,"Finally saw this film\, I absolutely loved it. Finally getting kickass women who are great roll models. I loved how Furey lost his eye\, Goose...Bri did a great job. On par with and above most marvel films. Haters goons hate but thereï¿ 1/2(TM)s no reason not to love it. The pace was good\, story line\, characters\, very pleased.",True
146847,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"I was really excited to see the movie\, but it was disapponting. Brie Larsonâ~s performance wasnâ~t good and the storytelling has been so bad you had no chance to get an idea who that character is. The only thing I saw was a cringy character who tried to be cool and fight patriarchy. They wonâ~t ever let us watch a movie again without putting in a political agenda\, will they? I wanted to see an inspiring new female superhero\, got a faceless puppet instead. Without the brillant Samuel L Jackson the film would have been a complete desaster\, because Brie Larson is neither likable nor funny.",True
153563,Captain Marvel,2019-10-06,2,Meh at best.  Utterly formulaic (which is nothing new to marvel) but somehow manages to be dulling missable. If you are thinking you need to watch this in order to make sense of the later marvel film fear not you get everything  need to know from the main series. Shame I wanted this move to be great but it just wasn't  ,True
111946,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,4,"Can't understand the really negative reviews.  It is a fun film. Acting is good\, it has a decent number of jokes\, the action is good and the script was decent and had a really good swerve\, which I wasn't expecting.",True
146342,Captain Marvel,2019-05-01,5,"I wantet Popcon Kino with OP Hero\, I got Popcorn Kino with OP Hero!",True
163032,Captain Marvel,2019-03-19,2,"Pretty boring\, I almost fell asleep.  Brie Larson's acting was not great and seemed robotic\, also her one liners were terrible.  I think out of all of the Marvel movies I laughed the least in this. Overall\, very bland\, I would almost recommend skipping it before Endgame.",True
144606,Captain Marvel,2019-04-19,5,It was entertaining ,True
132970,Captain Marvel,2019-05-09,4,"I genuinely enjoyed this movie\, I won't go into huge detail but I was entertained and look forward to seeing more in the future.",True
110433,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,0,Boring and Bland. The acting was something fit for a B movie. I’ve always loved the Marvel films but this is such a disappointment. If I could have given this 0 stars I would have ,True
125385,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,Great movie!!!!   Epic and lots of humor.  An awesome new hero is hero!,True
138812,Captain Marvel,2019-03-30,4,I really enjoy a strong female-centric story that is without the romance or damsel-in-distress act. Women can kick ass and it's shown in this wonderful movie! Love Brie Larson and her vulnerability and sweet voice. Act 2 and 3 of the movie is so much better than the beginning. the start was a little bit too slow and draggy,True
126339,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,1,Great Samuel L jackson.  Poor script decision and acting. Boring action sequences,True
102501,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,Amazing! One of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movies! \nGoing to see at least 2 more times in theaters!,True
103333,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,3,An average Marvel movie with some exciting twists and set pieces that should leave you satisfied by the end.,True
178124,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,4,The quality of Marvel films continues to improve! Captain Marvel was a better film than Wonder Woman and on par with Ironman 1 and Winter Soldier.,True
184471,Captain Marvel,2019-04-26,0,This movie is a shit,True
162673,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,Poor overall movie.  Does not fit in well with the rest of the MCU.  Too many plot holes and stupid nods that donâ(TM)t fit with the overall picture.,True
134604,Captain Marvel,2019-04-20,4,"I liked it\, a lot\, but could have been better if they had less explaining to do",True
149295,Captain Marvel,2019-03-17,4,"Larson is no Gal Gadot. She could be replaced by any other number of more competent actresses for Avengers: Endgame and I wouldn't miss her. Really this movie was all about stitching things together and preparing the MCU audience for Endgame.  The cat wasn't THAT damn funny.  Still\, it didn't suck\, and I was entertained.",True
159488,Captain Marvel,2019-07-20,5,One of my favorite Marvel movies! Fun but never taking itself too seriously.,True
144009,Captain Marvel,2019-03-28,4,It was a good movie but had a slow start to the movie as well as some jokes that didn't land.,True
123869,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,Good movie with an interesting plot for avengers endgame but not good enough compared to the previous marvel movies,True
139183,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,5,"I really like the movie\, and now capitain marvel is my favorite super hero",True
125217,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,Great movie! Brie Larson is likable as hell and I can’t wait to see how she helps out our avengers! Thanos is screwed!,True
155489,Captain Marvel,2019-04-04,4,"My niece and I were both hyped to see this movie and left a little disappointed. I was hoping for more from Marvel’s first female led\, superhero movie. I guess I was hoping it would have an engaging plot and action like Wonder Woman. It was a good movie\, but I wanted them to give us a GREAT movie like Captain America\, the Black Panther and the Avengers. Maybe now that they have laid out the origin movie\, the next one can be better.",True
105648,Captain Marvel,2019-03-22,2,"Aside from several funny Nick Fury scenes\, the movie was forgetable",True
177229,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,3,"The movie was good\, but not great. Ms. Larson acting was kind of dry\, like a robot. Maybe that was the intention of the director\, I donâ(TM)t know.\n\nThe story was awesome and the timeline is great.",True
106276,Captain Marvel,2019-06-16,4,"At first I wasn’t sure of this movie. But after watching it for a second time I realized I was viewing this movie in the wrong light. I’ve been wowed by the MCU I went in with very high expectations. Then I realized this is an origin movie. There isn’t much amazing things that go on during an origin story. Action isn’t the star\, the story is. Once I viewed it how it is and not what I was expecting I was very pleased. I was very surprised by Jude Law. I’ve never seen any of his movies\, maybe one\, Spy which is a comedy. But Jude Law is a pretty boy\, he’s there to just look good. So once I saw how he did with his character I was surprised. He did a good job. Only let down was how rather disappointed on how Nick fury lost his eye...the last time he trusted someone he lost his eye...and it was a flurken...",True
148120,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,"Just a sad excuse for a marvel movie. They series should’ve left the whole movie out of the franchise and just added the last 5 minutes as post credit scenes during a Thor\, guardians of the galaxy or actually decent marvel movie ",True
120384,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,5,Fantastic movie.  It is an amazing sHe-ros journey!  Loved the 90s music.,True
187831,Captain Marvel,2019-08-21,1,This was an exercise in making a political point first and a movie second. You can make films with stong female leads (see Alien and Terminator) but the story comes first not the other way around. Make a film with your political point first and the viewer can feel like they are bieng force fed propaganda. ,True
135261,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,I loved it!  Had a blast watching,True
183884,Captain Marvel,2019-07-14,5,This movie full on was amazing; there were some scenes that were so powerful they left me in tears. A beautiful introduction for the character. ,True
102143,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,Amazing. Its one of best origin stories in the MCU. Its again amazing !,True
139127,Captain Marvel,2019-04-29,5,i really liked the move and i think that brie larson is perfect for the role,True
121257,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,2,First I had to jump through hoops to get this review done so I hope RT does not remove it. The movie was not inline with other MCU movies. It was like a weird distant cousin that you see at the grocery store duck and walk in the other direction hoping they donâ(TM)t see you. The movie is terrible and a complete waste of money and time. I will not do any spoilers but some things are so cringeworthy and donâ(TM)t make sense.,True
139434,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,2,I remember this one interview of Stan Lee where he said that he didn't like superman because he was not vulnerable enough for a superhero and I'm afraid what DC did with justice league i don't wanna to see that in Endgame... I didn't like Carol Danvers for the same reason Stan didn't like superman but I trust Russo brother's vision and we've witnessed this kind of scenario when Thor came out but we liked him better in Joss whedon's hands. So I desparately hope Russo brothers do some justice to the loyal fanbase. Power to the Russos  ð(TM),True
97268,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,4,"9/10\, pretty friggin awesome\, apart from the fact that some things just didnâ(TM)t make sense. Like when Akira already knew how to use Carols suits Color thing\, but apart from that it was amazing\, def recommended",True
129470,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"I am giving it 5 stars because the trolls are giving it half a star which is not accurate.\n\nIjn reality this movie is 3 and a half stars\, enjoyable\, plot seemed all over the place and I feel like it was really lacking a \""oh crap\"" moment to really cement her as the most powerful hero in the universe.\n\nAslo I felt like she fell short to inspire \, both through charisma and strength factor \, she is the most powerful hero yet I feel that shen she stands next to Thor or Captain America they both had more powerful compelling stories to push the saga forward\, hell even Wolverine .\n\nI guess we will see in end games",True
119242,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,Excellent. As good of a storyline you can get with an overpowered character. Did a great job of having a female role model without making it overwhelmingly feminist. Bri Larsen did amazing with the role. Can’t wait to see Endgame!,True
147084,Captain Marvel,2019-04-14,2,I was very skeptical about seeing this movie due to the controversies surrounding it. But after seeing it I can honestly say the movie itself is nothing really special.,True
177662,Captain Marvel,2019-04-08,4,The only problems with this movie is lack of character and personality in the leading role. Overall there was great themes and I feel they did well with not making it overly political and the pacing was very balanced.,True
108136,Captain Marvel,2019-03-16,0,"Bad plot\, bad actor\, bad virtue signaling. Donâ(TM)t waste your money.",True
163656,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,2,"Pushing the politics into a movie industry targeting hardcore fans as will never do any good. \nPolitics aside i have watched the movie and all i can say us that is below mediocre at best. Bree is simply not up for the task\, acting was weak\, there was a too many comedy moments and the tryharding to make her look badass is just cringe at best.\nTake your time Marvel and think about your actions\, since this is not the way.\nAfter a great piece you did\, called wonder woman\, this is total fiasco...",True
119004,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"Everything I wanted from a Captain Marvel movie and more. Lives up to the heart and soul of the Kelly Sue DeConnick run on the comic book\, and celebrates women\, friendships\, and feminism in the best way. Definitely believe Brie Larson's Captain Marvel could and would punch a dinosaur in the face.",True
102360,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,Amazing movie.   Loved every second.,True
142616,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,2,"Its Captain Meh-Vel. I want to say I went to this movie\, with an open mind. But i could not believe this is a MCU Movie. \n\nTo Start I like the 90's setting\, Sam L Jackson as Nick fury\, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos the skrull and Goose the Cat. \n\nI found this movie boring on all fronts.. The Script is bad. Jokes fall flat. Brie Larson is stone cold. It feels like a bad 90's superhero movie. I would call this the Worst MCU Movie. \n\nThis Movie can hurt the MCU\, It made Captain Marvel so powerful that everyone before is useless. I hope that there is some type of damage control to Save it. But here hoping. It has also left a  bad taste\, which could affect Endgame. \n\nI would not suggest going to this movie\, wait till it comes out on a streaming service",True
157937,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,0,Not really good action sequences.,True
193535,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,Was looking forward to a big lead up to End Game.  Sadly the acting and the action did not deliver.  I would read the cliffnotes on this one.,True
148732,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,"Just watched it yesterday\, MCU did their best again\, and I'm really pleased with the movie\, the story is unpredictable\, good chemistry between characters especially Carol Danvers and Nick Fury.",True
159490,Captain Marvel,2019-04-18,5,one of my favorite Marvel movies so far!,True
97259,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,4,90`s movie released today.,True
146138,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,"I've watched the movie on March 8th in a Germany cinema\, and I liked it. it's the best MCU movie so far\, I think. Brie Larson and the other actresses and actors played well.",True
163314,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,Probably my favorite MCU character to date! Loved Goose and loved the 90s music and references. Canâ(TM)t wait to see Captain Marvel in Endgame and canâ(TM)t wait for a Captain Marvel Sequel!!,True
122812,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,1,Generic and dull.\nWaste of Brie Larsons talent.\nJust another by the books marvel film.,True
140978,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,"I thought it was a really great movie\, i went i. Expecting it would be a mid level marvel film but it is easily up there with there better dine films.",True
104014,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,"Another fun and exciting Marvel movie with great action set pieces and a lot of humour\, especially for those of us who remember the 90s. I'd actually give this 4 stars\, but since an army of assholes made it their mission to tank the audience score\, 5 stars it is. Suck it douche weasels.",True
180249,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,1,"They definitely  miscast Larson for this role\, she is bland with no character or personality. Probably the worst marvel movie to date. As a marvel fan i pray Endgame isn't a euphemism for the Marvel cinematic universe. I'm not sure if Kevin Fiege is losing his touch or just losing control over Marvel\, but this doesn't bode well moving forward.",True
122426,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"fun\, funny\, and empowering.",True
97920,Captain Marvel,2019-03-17,5,"Absolutely amazing\, the whole movie theater giving a standing ovation after both the opening scene with Stan Lee and after the movie had ended. It was a light hearted twist for in between IW and Endgame and was so amazingly uplifting for women and correct on so many levels on what women go through.",True
124341,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,5,"Great addition to the Marvel movies.  Very fun ride!!  Enjoyed getting to see Fury and Colton in the past and how they came to know Captain Marvel.  Didn't think I would like Larson in this movie\, but she nailed it!!",True
184133,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"This movie has truly gotten a lot of hate and negative reactions\, but when I went to go see it it was incredibly empowering\, made me laugh and cry\, and it was truly amazing.",True
188793,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,"Thought it was brilliant! I've been taking my children to see the Marvel movies since they were old enough to understand all that was going on. I also made the ones they didn't see available so they could see what they had missed when they were young. \n\nI just love the the fact that my daughter got to finally see a powerful female superhero. I'm not discounting Black Widow\, Scarlett Witch or their TV counterparts at all\, just saying it was about time Marvel gave us a movie based upon a female superhero who was strong\, powerful and able to stand out on her own. Well done Marvel!",True
116756,Captain Marvel,2019-10-05,5,Does it work? The short answer is: yes. There's enough to keep both diehard Marvel fans and newcomers engaged.,True
123792,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,4,"Good movie not the best marvel movie but fun\, and exciting.",True
183758,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"This movie does not deserve the hate that it’s gotten. Brie Larson does a great job in portraying Carl Danvers\, and her performance\, in my opinion\, was not wooden as many reviewers have stated. I really enjoyed the chemistry between her and Samuel Jackson\, and each scene with them both flowed so well. The action sequences\, and CGI were very well done. My only issue was that some of the action scenes were a bit too dark and hard to make out who was fighting who. Overall\, it was another fantastic film in the MCU\, and I can’t wait to see Captain Marvel make her appearance in Endgame. ",True
138780,Captain Marvel,2019-03-22,5,"I really don't get how people can hate on this movie. Great acting\, great action\, great origin story. There was mystery and intrigue in the plot to keep me watching and a great setup for her role in Avengers Endgame. Extra credit for the love they gave Stan Lee in this film. A solid 90% for this film\, critics and audience are wrong on this one.",True
148524,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,4,"Just saw Captain Marvel! A pretty balanced and funny movie!! 3.5/5 stars for me! It's missing more familiar faces for me\, but I've only seen like 6 marvel movies so far\, and the story lacked originality and was really cliche 1/2 1/2 1/2 (C). My real problem with it is that it felt like Black Panther\, like it was addressing women (while Black Panther addressed colored people\,) and didn't come into being because it was good. But it had some amazing moments and some poor moments.\n\nA pretty good movie worth a watch if you haven't caught it yet!",True
115468,Captain Marvel,2019-04-28,4,"Did not like how they portrayed the Skrulls or Nick Fury...completely watered-down and essentially de-powered. They are supposed to be so badass in the comics\, and Nick Fury is a total force in every other movie except this one. Otherwise\, the movie was \""OK\"".",True
143925,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,3,"It was a decent movie. Filled with cute easter eggs and moments. I enjoyed it\, but it does not compare to the other major MCU movies such as Avengers\, ironman\, Guardians of the galaxy\, Dr Strange\, Captain America\, Black Panther\, Spider-Man\, Antman & The Wasp.",True
174163,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"The film is disappointing on many levels. It could and should have been so much better\, especially given that is the last film before Endgame. The story doesn't make a lot of sense\, and the characters do not remain true to their motivations. The start is confusing since it is made up of flashbacks. Jackson is superb\, but many other characters are either underused\, or superfluous. Visually the film is confused and dark. Larson is adequete. She plays the role in a wooden way\, but that is part of the character. The cat is a mcguffin\, and as a fan\, I hate its role in Fury's eye. Overall its watchable\, but far worse than most Marvel films.",True

177051,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,"The movie was actually pretty good. I was surprised. Contrary to what I had expected based on what people had been saying\, I though Brie Larson's acting was pretty good. She did seem detached\, but not blank as people have suggested. Her emotional role was more complex than most other comic book movie characters in my opinion Without spoiler\, I can say she was playing someone who was confused\, didn't know who she was\, and her power (mental and physical) had been repressed. This is her origin story\, where she breaks through this all\, finds out who she really is\, and emerges as an immensely powerful person. There is a strong female empowerment theme going on. Contrary to some peoples opinions\, I think that it truly is empowering/inspiring\, and not a distasteful. In the end\, she becomes an awesome\, powerful superhero. It will be fun to watch her in the future movies\, battling with her full power alongside the other heroes.",True
187842,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"This was an incredibly fun adventure. Was the humor as hilarious as Thor Ragnarok\, no. Did the stakes feel as high as infinity war\, not quite. But this wasn't about the jokes or the gravitas. It was about about a great story\, a hero's origin\, and it was entertaining\, heartwarming\, and so well done. I love the subtle sense of humor\, the 90s vibes\, and the main character's likability. Not only do I want her to win and want her on earth's side\, I'd love to have a beer with her and listen to 90s tunes . Great start for a character I can't wait to see more of.",True

Captain Marvel is a total blast. Never once does it feel like feminist propaganda\, either. It is a fun and awesome action movie with great leads and a great heart. Larson kills it as the titular hero and Talos is another stand out star\, along with Goose and Fury. Go see this movie if you want a fun\, innocent time at the movies.

137810,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,5,Incredible movie so many nostalgic callbacks to the 90's. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end!!!!!,True
112281,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"Captain Marvel is a welcome addition to the MCU but admittedly her story arc suffered within the structure of this film. The film focused too much on trying to subvert the superhero origin formula that it came at the expense of not having a clear path of growth where the audience follows Carol through her fall and her journey to picking herself up and the self-reflection internally taking place. The fragments of memories building up her past and struggles aren't sufficient in establishing an emotional link with the core of Carol.\n\nWhile it does lack the heart of some other MCU origin films\, it does still try to represent itself as a story with a hero who has to find themselves albeit with a character journey less transformative compared to other MCU origin stories. Overall\, Captain Marvel is an enjoyable film.  \n\nSome may have an issue with Carol's bold\, stubborn and wild personality but I really did enjoy her rebellious personality. We haven't had a character in the MCU who takes joy in unleashing on the battlefield such like Carol. \n\nHopefully within a sequel or during a later film we get to see a more contrasted Carol where she is burned by her over-confidence and begins to learn that it takes more than attitude and power to become a hero. Empathy and self-reflection are key elements in a person finding the hero within themselves. This is where I hope Endgame assist Carol\, by incorporating Carol within a team where she can't save the world alone\, she will need to accept her limitations and rely on others to fill in the aspects she herself is powerless to do anything about.",True

169658,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,3,"Started a little slow or weird\, then got funny/better when Earth action happened. Loved the funny parts about being in the 90's. Brie Larson was good delivering funny lines.\n\nI was a bit surprised by the plot twist\, and of course understood the noise that had been made about negative reviews. Not sure why the decision to make a woman-empowerment movie had to also engage in so much self-loathing of men generally\, white men & powerful specifically. The political overtones are too obvious and can reasonably cause discontent amongst movie viewers\, including easily accusing US of being the Krees...if your comic book action movie becomes a political movie\, don't be surprised some don't like it.\n\nIt also turned out to be a \""White Savior\"" movie in the end\, which takes away from the film's merits. We get it\, the message is clear: Men are horrible\, Women are amazing. Especially white women.\n\nThe message was a bit forced\, especially the lines the teen girl says \""If you don't go to space\, what message are you sending me?\"" I took my 2 early teen daughters and they liked it\, clearly understood the woman empowerment message.

She has a couple choice moments\, though\, and there’s Nick Fury\, Maria Rambeau\, Lt. Trouble\, Goose and Annette Bening. There were some really fun sequences\, but at times the pacing dragged.

I felt this movie was a weaker feature compared to most MCU films but it still had enough action and humour to have a good time watching. Brie Larson is fine as captain marvel but I do agree with others that her performance at times is flat and she appear to show no emotion at times in this movie even though character states she shows too much\, I do think Larson is a good actor and will do well with this character in the future. Sam Jackson is great once again as Nick Fury and the CG to make him younger was phenomenal and was unnoticeable most of the time.

VERY disappointed in for Marvel for the first time in 10 years. The quality of the film was equivalent to your typical movie on SYFY channel. The pacing was very slow. There was no character build up. The dialog was choppy and bland. It felt like every science fiction trope for the last 30 years was wedged in with little to no originality or thought.\n  This was a character I had never heard of but was excited to see because I have always trusted Marvel to understand what we want and give us truly enjoyable movies. I'm going to have to do more research in the future since it seems you can no longer trust Marvel to deliver high quality entertainment\, and I'll be doubly mistrusting when they are introducing new and unheard of characters. \n  With the price of movie tickets and the variety of good alternative movies to see in the theaters\, I strongly recommend that you do not waste your money or time on this film.

WIth all the out-of-the-park hits from the MCU\, I wasn't expecting this albatross of a movie. Very disappointing. Disney should fire Larson.

178782,Captain Marvel,2019-05-16,3,"There were several enjoyable parts to the movie as a standalone\, but not enough to make it something I would strongly recommend. They pretty much run an inferior Steve Rogers arc over 3 movies crammed into one. This lack of Carol's character development; her drive and resolve was put front and center the over the top 'Girl power scenes' everyone is clamoring about. Shrug it off and relax as it didn't make or break the movie.\n\nThis movie would have been better suited for one of Marvels TV offerings. It does contain the greatest Stan Lee cameo of all Marvel films.\n\nHowever within the MCU\, it felt rushed in order to be shoe-horned in time for Endgame\, and ultimately ends up on the bottom tier of the three phase\, 22 film Marvel Cinematic Universe.

147381,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,2,"I went to see this film in spite of the agenda marketing which was\, in my opinion\, very counter productive. This film was probably the worst character intro film Marvel has released since establishing the MCU\, but probably on par with Thor 2 or Iron Man 2/3. It's not terrible\, it is still better than most of the DCEU films except Wonder Woman\, a film that did just about everything right. My main issue is that the character's journey is a little weak. She is a badass superhero rediscovering who she used to be\, which was a badass fighter pilot. There isn't a lot of character growth for Carol\, we don't really see her as anything other than awesome\, even in her previous life. It really wasn't quite as exciting or compelling as other Marvel character debuts. I think much of that falls to the character\, she is overpowered\, like Superman in some ways\, but without much of the charm. Overall\, an OK film that wasn't as bad as I expecting. There were some 'agenda' moments that felt a little forced\, and at least one major Nick Fury character moment that was turned into a bit of a joke which seemed like a waste\, but I didn't hate it.

The fact that she is female affects the plot in several subtle ways\, but overall it's a story and she's a character that could be relatable or inspiring to anyone.\nIt's not perfect\, and in my opinion Wonder Woman was a better female-led superhero film\, but if you're saying that this movie is trash\, then 90% of the MCU films are also trash.

145446,Captain Marvel,2019-06-25,2,It was so boring. I wish I could like it. Formulaic yet the moral storyline was confusing and the political one was contradicting.

112078,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,2,"Captain Marvel Failed to live up to the hype. Brie Larsen was more of an emotionless robot than earth saving heroin\, unrelatable as a hero and as an earthling. Plot was poorly written and doesnt do anything to advance the MCU as a whole.\nI found myself bored more often than not and at one point caught myself dozing off. The writers took extreme liberty with the character changing her mythos so much shes virtually unrecognizable which was a shame. Also the big plot twist of making the \""Skrulls\"" the good guys was a huge slap in the face to marvel fans and stan lee who created the iconic villians whove been shapping the marvel universe since fantastic four #2.\nI also was dismayed at how they treated Nick Fury. Instead of the badass we know him as they treated him like a campy sidekick their only for laughs\, essentially neutering marvels biggest pit bull.\nSoundtrack was great\, and stan lees cameo was amazing\, probably the highlight of the film\, credit roll in the beggining nearly brought a tear to my eye.\nNot Marvel's worse film to date\, but definitely falls short.

That being said\, this movie wouldnâ(TM)t stand on its own even if it was independent of the other two movies mentioned above. Brie Larson tried her best but never really evolved in an interesting way after the first scene. The plot was pretty standard for a Marvel movie. The only thing keeping this movie from total disappointment was the call backs and tie-ins to the MCU.

186776,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,2,"This movie was not good.\n\nThe plot was sloppy\, and mostly served as a vehicle for quips between Danvers (Brie Larson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Sometimes they are funny\, but not enough to keep the movie going.\n\nSome claim that Captain Marvel is a strong female character. But having superpowers does not make one strong â\"" in the sense that matters for ordinary humans.

Captain Marvel did not win any fights\, often being thrown to the ground and having to be bailed out. When she did\, she would give them mercy\, leaving a bad taste. Her whole role in the film was the wipe men's asses because they couldn't wipe it themselves\, and felt like the reason why the movie was made was so she could wipe Iron Man's ass later. No character development - the only was that her emotions got the better of her\, and by the end she was able to suppress them in order to become stronger\, which is laughably horrific when you think about the treatment of women throughout the centuries coupled with Captain Marvel standing next to the Hulk.\nBesides these feminist woes\, Captain Marvel was not enough as a stand alone movie\, and felt like a filler episode for the Avengers.",True

I am looking forward to Captain Marvel returning and enjoyed getting more back story on the Kree. I loved the friendship between Carol and Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau - it felt very real.

112626,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,2,"Captain Marvel was hyped to be one of the biggest and best adventures and origin stories in the MCU. However\, this film falls disappointingly short. Captain Marvel herself came across as cold and unlikeable for the majority of the film and with her being portrayed as being so powerful it meant anytime she was in danger I never bought into it so never cared about her character. Even Iron Man\, Thor\, Captain America etc in their origin stories had something which made them vulnerable which made us buy into their characters. The twist was predictable and overall had the feeling of being released for the sake of needing to introduce Captain Marvel before Endgame rather than wanting to make a Captain Marvel film. In all honesty this film does a better job of furthering Fury's character than Captain Marvel. I understand they wanted to produce a female fronted MCU movies\, which is great\, but being a marvel movie. It will have hype. And if it doesn't live up to that hype then it falls by the wayside. It feels like a side mission rather than part of the main story. I hope in Endgame they are able to make her character gel with the other avengers. Overall\, disappointing\, predictable story with boring twist\, waste of Jude Law and other fantastic actors\, good comedy!\, Incredible de-aging of Fury and Coulson\, great to see Coulson and the Skrull was a welcome change. But unfortunately fell painfully short of the bar it set for itself. Which is a shame",True

I thought Brie Larson was amazing in the movie The Room but I just felt like her performance was flat in this one. She had the look and the moves but I just thought he voice was very monotone and lacked real depth or feeling. LaShana Lynch had passion in spades and was great as Rambeau.

I also felt more of a connection to the main character\, and felt that Brie's performance came through in a better way the second time around. The way Larson presents the character might be interpreted as \""a bad performance\"" in the way that she does not show a lot of emotion. However\, I would argue that this is a result of her portraying the feeling of being lost.

The villain was easily dislikable\, as they should be\, and the supporting cast was solid enough to get behind.

200058,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,4,"\""You know anything about a lady blowing up a Blockbuster? Witnesses say she was dressed for laser tag.\""\n\nThe MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) will soon complete its third phaseâ\""the first three phases are collectively known as The Infinity Saga. April 26th marks the release of Avengers: Endgame a film that will wrap up a 21-film story arc that has spanned 11 years (or almost 80 years in the universe itself). The majority of these films (outside of the first Captain America film - 1942) take place relatively recently\, starting with Iron Man (which takes place in 2008 or 2011 depending on who you ask). However\, Captain Marvel bucks this trend and takes us back to the mid-90's.\n\nThe movie travels back in time to a period of grunge music\, neon clothes\, fanny packs\, Blockbuster video\, and dial-up internet. The world was a different place and Captain Marvel nails the nostalgia factor perfectly. The film is far from perfect\, but still does enough to be a solid entry\, which has already grossed close to the billion dollar mark.\n\nThe most interesting thing from a story standpoint is that it's told in a reverse order to some extent. The story unfolds as it goes forward. Oscar winning actress Brie Larson (Room) plays the title character to the best of her abilities; however\, she seems to be held back by directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. While not first time directors\, they don't have much of a track record outside of TV shows and some films even I've never heard of. I don't think that they were able to bring out the best in a film that was awkwardly shoved into this universe (serving as both a prequel and a sequel) before the release of arguably the biggest cinematic event ever...\n\nThat's not to say that the film is without its merits; the story itself had several fun twists and turns. The de-aging of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) worked seamlessly. The effects (as always) were some of the best in the business\, and of course Marvel's trademark comedy was able to break up any serious moments within minutes. I do believe that we will see a different Captain Marvel when Endgame comes out (directed by Anthony and Joe Russo). We'll see a much better directed version of her and she will shine even in limited screen time.\n\nI'm curious to see where she goes in the \""future.\"" After Endgame\, the MCU will be different (and yet the same). Some have projected that Captain Marvel will be the new key that holds the universe together (similar to what Iron Man was for the first three phases). There have been rumors of a female-only team with the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)\, Gamora (Zoe Saldana)\, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen)\, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson)\, or others joing together for their own film as well. Will she get another solo film? Will it take place in the 90's again? Or in the present day? So many unanswered questions...\n\nAs an interesting side note\, Captain Marvel was originally a hero first created for Fawcett Comics. DC comics then sued them because of the similarity to Superman. DC gained the rights eventually\, until Marvel sued DC because of the name \""Captain Marvel.\"" DC then changed the name to SHAZAM and that's where we stand now. That's why there is a Shazam movie coming out within a month of this one. (Comic history can be confusing!)",True

Iï¿ 1/2(TM)d rate it up there with the first Captain America movie\, easy. I think I need to get a Captain Marvel jacket now? And more fistfights set to No Doubt songs. \n\nMy favorite part was the buddy-comedy sort of relationship that Carol and young Nick Fury had. And I remembered that one of the previous Marvel movies had a line where Fury mentioned that he had a friend once\, and trusting them was what caused him to lose his eye. When that happened\, it justï¿ 1/2really hit me. You learn a lot of new things about Fury in this movie.

Brie Larsen's character persona lacks depth of any kind. Annette Benning is also stilted\, and what happened to Samuel L. Jackson's Fury? So watered down\, even silly in this film. Where is the intensity? This movie was more of a cartoon\, rather than the fun fantasy stories I've come to love. I hope it's not a foreshadowing of the quality of Endgame.

112311,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,5,Captain marvel is everything I ever needed! This movie is amazing!!! Bad ratings are from guys that can't handle a movie about a girl who is better than everyone else and doesn't feature her sexuality at all.

98150,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"Absolutely great movie. Pretty standard for a superhero origin story plot\, but it’s a fun ride. Great ‘90s\, Sc-FI\, and Aviation references placed throughout. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson have great chemistry on screen.",True
101330,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,2,"Almost everything about this movie feels like wasted potential. From the 90s references to the titular character herself\, nothing feels completely fleshed out in a way that is satisfying. The majority of the plot centers around Carol Danvers figuring out who she is\, and by the end of the movie\, I still couldn't tell you. \n\nThe writing is quite disjointed\, and I really don't know what defines her personality\, because it often seems to change even mid scene. She is strong\, I guess? The digital de-aging of Sam Jackson is an amazing feat\, and for that alone it receives a star. Unfortunately\, though\, placing Nick Fury in this movie is really a waste. While I liked all of his scenes here\, because he elevates Larson's rather poor acting\, it causes issues with his characterization within the continuity of the rest of the Marvel universe. Part of the allure of the Nick Fury character is how he is mysterious\, and like all prequels\, they have removed that. Danver's sloppy characterizations means she works best when she is onscreen with a personality that is better defined\, like Fury or her friend Monica\, but doesn't work with Jude Law or the other \""aliens.\""\n\nThere are times that I recognized the movie was trying to have some sort of emotional beat\, but there wasnâ(TM)t enough groundwork laid to actually sell it. Similarly\, there is a twist that suffers from the same issue\, as there really isnâ(TM)t any justification or ramifications in the later scenes. Shouldnâ(TM)t Captain Marvel feel something for now fighting against her former friends\, people that she has spent years training and having fun with? Why is the huge emotional impact of her or them being traitors missing? There might have been a kernel of a good story here\, but it needed at least a few more passes to get it right.\n\nWriting: quite poor; Acting: mediocre for the main character\, okay for everyone else; Special Effects: stunning.",True
110995,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,0,"Brie Larson does a good job\, but no performance can save this ham-fisted script and direction.

I often find myself asking \""why should we care?\"" And the ending \""plot twist\"" was actually very predictable. The acting in the movie was fine\, Sam Jackson played a great part\, Ben Mendelsohn same. The rest were just meh. Story was weak\, weird\, and paced terribly.

Look at HiTop films to explain why\, i just cant do it justice. It was actually so bad i had to close my eyes because the cringe was so bad.

186344,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,"This movie was awesome! Twists and turns I wasnt expecting. I loved it and my friends (who aren't even marvel fans) loved it. The acting was great\, humor on point\, and the story really drew you in. Definitely one of my new favorite marvel movies.",True
136368,Captain Marvel,2019-05-02,3,"I'm all for empowering women and burning down the patriarchy\, but not with shoehorned political messages like this. Wonder Woman showed us what it was trying to say. Captain Marvel just preached.",True
97360,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,3,A average movie by Marvel's standards. There are pacing problems and a good portion of the writing was just bad. In the end the references and characters are good and I look forward to seeing more of this world. ,True

This is the 21st of the series; it's been done too many times.\nAs for the whole pro-women agenda...\nPlease\, anyone looking at this with 2 ounces of wit can see the main character has an unfair advantage over everyone. How is this empowerment?

160865,Captain Marvel,2019-05-04,2,Only reason to watch this is that it is a Marvel movie. The character is not likable and as a comic fan this is not an interesting character.

105568,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,4,"As far as Marvel origin films\, it places higher than many of the others because it doesn't feel forced or over-the-top. Samuel L.

192094,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,4,Very good film! I enjoyed everything from beginning to end. And I’m not going to give it a perfect score just because people are trashing it based on the film having a female lead as the hero. I appreciated the build up for what’s to come in the next avengers film. ,True

154800,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,Movie was pretty lack luster compared to the trailers they had. Thereâ(TM)s really no reason to see this movie for endgame coming up because the only stuff that has value really is the mid credit scene witch was posted before the movie even came out.,True
118048,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,3,"Enjoyable. Some funny parts. Decent action. Brie runs kind of funny\, not like you would expect a superhero to run. Skrull stole the movie though. And the cat. Samuel L is well Samuel L. Looking forward to Avengers.",True
145370,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,4,"It was pretty good!  I enjoyed it.  It had some problems though.  Marvel tried to use the movie to answer MCU questions and tie things together.  Easter eggs are fun\, but this felt like it was trying to close plot holes from other films.  Next time\, let the film stand on it's own.  I love the connected nature of the MCU\, but balance is important.  Too many easter eggs and explanations can ruin a movie and I feel it slightly lowered the quality of this movie.",True

153000,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,3,"Marketing matters. Through all of the divisiveness I still wanted the movie to be good. I wasn't exactly disappointed\, but continuity errors and some clunky dialogue stuck out a little. The VFX didn't bother me until the big final fight sequence in space (arguably where it mattered most). Larson and Jackson had great chemistry. But Fury's scratched out eye thing was a load of shit. Build up the mystery in the Winter Soldier and then throw it away. Last Jedi levels of carelessness right there. All in all\, I have hope that the Russos will handle her better in Endgame than she was in her own film. Try to stay positive.",True
176802,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,0,"The movie is visiually dull. The story telling is nearly offensively formulaic. The fight sequences are mostly lackluster. Larson's performance lacks the charisma and grandeur a character the importance of Captain Marvel must possess. Overall\, there is little to write home about\, other than the fact that this plot is a forceful\, absurd intrusion on the decade-long build up of the MCU collective story.",True

144437,Captain Marvel,2020-02-22,4,"It was a well-done origin story that reached out especially to women viewers. For that\, I appreciated the movie even more.",True
105742,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"A slow first half due to how much setup is needed\, but from the second onward it picks up and gets in shape. Some moments were a bit predictable\, but for every prediction there was a moment I thought I'd guessed that pulled the rug out from under me\, so it balances out. Not an End Game or Black Panther\, but I'd say on par with Thor 1\, or Ant-Man. Middle of the pack sort of movie.",True

134581,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"I liked all the other character's acting better than Larson's. It is weird that her abilities are not well defined. Overall\, the film was still entertaining due to the supporting cast and visuals. I have a feeling that the director told her to act without emotion and like she was awkwardly regaining it. Even with that knowledge\, the way that was acted out did not work well. ",True
196191,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,1,"When the namesake of the movie\, isn't even the best character\, it's not a good movie. It could have had an awesome story\, been empowering for women\, AND had appeal to both genders\, by simply having a good story\, that added to the universe that has long since been established\, but I don't see how it did any of those.",True

191928,Captain Marvel,2019-04-04,5,"Very entertaining\, fun and easy to watch\, is not the best of Marvel but is one of the best in my opinion with Captain America \, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. I honestly don't understand how Aquaman with all the flaws that it had has gotten better reviews than this movie for fans\, it's certainly not bad as some people o most people say it was\, I frankly don't think that the people who said that actually saw the movie o mean that. That is not that good or the best I can agree with\, but that it was bad o that Brie Larson wasn't a fit for the role I don't\, I think that what actually could have happened is that most people stick with what the first trailer sold\, but it wasn't actually how the movie ended up being\, is just that the trailer mostly show the first parts of the movie and the way that Captain Marvel was trained to be\, a cold and emotional controlled soldier\, but that quickly change.",True

127147,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,4,"Has the entertainment value typical of Marvel films\, but falls short from truly standing out amongst its peers. Throughout the film\, it always felt like it wasn't leaning hard enough in any one direction; a sentiment which is also true of Larson's portrayal as the title character. Given the mix of directions that the comics have taken the character recently\, it's not surprising that the MCU incarnation would suffer from a similar lack of identity. ",True

161576,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,2,"Over-the-top feminism.  Writers more interested in making a statement than a good movie.  The female characters drip with \""girl-power\"" themes.  The male characters are generally evil or a bit submissive.  Even Samuel Jackson's \""Nick Fury\"" is muted compared with other appearances.  I have no problem with girl-power movies (e.g. Wonder Woman) but this forces viewpoints unnaturally into the script.",True
137103,Captain Marvel,2019-05-01,2,"I must be missing a point\, I can't find a place on the timeline  for Captain Marvel\, apparently it's 6 years after 1989 which gives us 1995\, so Captain America was the first Avenger before the Avengers even exist? According to Captain Marvel plus the tesseract location/possetion won't add up if we follow the timeline from Captain America The first Avenger (1942) to Captain Marvel (1995). So many questions\, so many unanswered questions.",True
164024,Captain Marvel,2019-04-01,0,"Really boring movie\, almost slept through the movie. Little or no character depth. The film doesn't really make us care about the lead character because the film fails to add any depth to the character and it feels like the character is being kept in check\, in fact every other characters had more depth than the lead.\nAlso\, the lead character has little or no expressions and appears stone-like and is really irritating at times. Carol Denvers doesn't really do anything to amaze or inspire us or make us fall in love with the character.\nHumor from the lead character seems forced and unnatural\, because she seems bored most of the time\, Carol Denvers is not a really funny character. Samuel L Jackson\, Ben Mendelsohn and Jude Law were the best parts of the film since\, the lead character didn't have much to do and they do try in every way to save the movie.\nThe whole movie seems to be based on convenient plot twists. If something happens it is because the plot demands it so.\nFrom technical standpoint\, bad lighting\, bad color palette choices (especially during the train fight scene)\, mediocre CGI and fight scenes really leaves much to be desired.\nIn a nutshell\, the movie has nothing really new to offer and really just seems like a passtime and a lazy attempt to introduce the Captain Marvel character while we wait for Avengers Endgame.",True

143476,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"It's slightly below average\, doesn't really add much the MCU\, just retcons a lot of stuff. Typical predictable plot etc. Think it will probably do better if it gets a sequel which no doubt it will.",True

And no point is it boring\,Â  and several times it truly soars. Is a culmination of where Marvel has been in the last ten years\,Â  and it points the way of where is going\,Â  and it's amazing.\nÂ I've heard people say it's \""standard Marvel\""\, and I've heard people go on (and on and on...) about the gender of our lead\,Â  making my soul *utterly* cringe each time. The phrase 'standard Marvel' much like the term 'average Superhero' itself is an oxymoron. Marvels 'standard' is so high above everyone elses A-game anymore that we take it for granted abs that's a miracle. \nÂ If you're somehow no longer impressed by the finished work of thousands of artists working for years collectively that somehow all works together to tell a rousing story of physically wounded and mentally scarred space warriors regaining their humanity and discovering their true power and purpose.... I dunno\, take a walk in the woods or something.Â  Get some wonder back in your soul. But stay off Rotten Tomatoes\,Â  cuz this movie was awesome and I'll fight you. \nAlso\, Ben Mendelson is an absolute unit in this movie\,Â  and he needs to be in everything now.Â  And I'd like to borrow the time machine they used to get 1994 Sam Jackson.Â  For reasons.",True

105932,Captain Marvel,2019-04-09,4,"As someone who didn't grow up reading Marvel comics\, I found Captain Marvel to be a really enjoyable film that stood on its own.  It was a good origin story that had just the right amount of humor and girl power. The only issue I took with this film was the lack of genuine peril for the main character\, but I believe that is largely due to her comic book origins as an overly powered superhero. Brie Larson was likeable and strong\, but people reviewing seem to forget about the supporting cast\, who were all excellent! Captain Marvel is going to be a good addition to the MCU and I have high hopes that Larson's portrayal of her character will play well against the other MCU characters.",True

The cat and Lieutenant Trouble created some great moments\, and the twists throughout kept things from being too predictable.

The movie itself was completely unnecessary for next month's Avengers Endgame. I truly hope they revamp this Character and make her more likeable if they are making her the lead in phase 4 or that will be the end of marvel and how it is now.

163322,Captain Marvel,2019-03-13,2,"Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far. Nothing about Cpt Marvel as a character felt natural\, the explanation for her powers felt something straight out of Sky High\, and she’s the least grounded character in the MCU.

Our new heroin possesses none of those qualities. ",True

I love the cat and the little girl. I loved that fact that the main character was so cocky. This movie fits in so well with Avengers. The end credit scenes (there are two) were pretty good too.

I went into the movie hoping that I would walk out with more excitement for Avengers End Game\, but instead was left with a bad taste in my mouth(and it wasn't the popcorn). I personally feel that it was the directing or possibly even the writing behind the movie which lead me to disliking Captain Marvel. The begging starts strong but quickly falls short for me when time after time I felt like I was being lead on a pointless Goose the cat chase. The Special effects where nothing to Marvel over compared to what we have seen in the past. However\, there where a few great camera shot done for the movie. The story at times felt very jumpy\, and there are many moments when the story or characters believe or understand something just for the sake of the movie. The comedy sadly was flat too\, and at times felt very.. Forced\, and some scenes too that if they hadn't been in the film we wouldn't have missed any story telling. There where some cool nods to the 90's\, but after a while it felt like to much. Finally it was sad to see so many past characters to be written down to be so weak(villains and hero's). I would have loved to see them at least put up a fight because who is going to be scared or frighten by and villain that just turns tail and runs. I hope that Captain Marvel is able to show us more in the upcoming Avengers movie\, and assist in giving us a movie everyone can enjoy.",True

If they had wanted Captain Marvel to be a genuine contender they should have introduced her to the universe a few years back and given us a couple of films first. I hope her actual presence in End Game will not take away from the ten years of money spent and time fans have invested on getting to love the MCU characters we have spent time getting to know and watch grow up and become the desreved heros they have grown into. What Disney did with Captain Marvel is what is wrong with DC movies\, DC put out a Superman movie a half batman half superman movie then a Wonderwoman movie and threw us into the high heat with a Justice League movie.  Marvel gave us a slow increase before we got Avengers gave us time to adjust to even the weaker Characters.",True

Never!!! lmao whatever\, but yeah I'm a woman(boooo) and this movie clicked with me more than any previous marvel film. Her powers being restrained by Jude Law combined with her history as marginalized pilot give her and the audience ample reason to feel frustrated\, both seem to be a representation of how women are treated by society(yes even America)\, and I absolutely adored every single minute of that relatability that I have largely found missing in the MCU's female characters. I'm so grateful that she\, along with Chadwick Boseman\, will be the mascot for the upcoming years of the MCU. I feel largely optimistic for the future of the MCU considering the gorgeous groundwork this and Endgame give for her\, considering how much more compelling every single of her Avenger forefathers later films made them; RDJ's story arc only came into it's own post Ultron\, Hemsworth's character retcon made Thor 100x more compelling to follow\, and Evans' stoic Captain America only became endearing once we realized that he would never back down from a fight.

196163,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,3,"When Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sent that message for an adapted pager seconds after Thanos' snap\, the expectation went up there. After all\, almost a year ago we were awaiting the arrival of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) as the potential heroine who would save the day in a universe that is in a lot of trouble and that was 50% decimated by the villain.\n\nAnd perhaps the biggest problem of \""Captain Marvel\"" is that expectation generated. Ally\, too\, to other factors. For example\, the threshold that some Marvel films have hit a few years ago. The work of director Anna Boden and director Ryan Fleck unfortunately can not be placed on the same shelf of films as \""Black Panther\"" (2018)\, \""Avengers: Infinite War\"" (2018)\, \""Captain America: The Winter Soldier\""\, \""Captain America: Civil War\"" (2016) and \""Guardians of the Galaxy\"" (2014)\, only to stay in some films of phases 2 and 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nor is it better than \""Wonder Woman\"" (2017)\, just to compare it with the best DC has created in recent years.\n\nIn fact\, \""Captain Marvel\"" is an uninspired movie\, its action scenes are far from being among the best ever produced by Marvel and fails to explore important aspects of the narrative around which the heroine was inserted.\n\nThe question is: Why instead of showing the umpteenth origin story with the same tiresome elements that we have already seen in other films of origin\, \""Captain Marvel\"" was not straightforward? In the case\, the war between Skrulls and Krees\, one of the most classic stories in the comics.\n\nIt is understandable the need to introduce the character. After all\, so far\, in the movies\, Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) had never even been mentioned. But the old bow \""Who am I really? \""Where did I come from?\"" \""What's my job in the world?\"" \""Why am I doing this?\"" \""What are you hiding from me?\"" - I finally rediscovered myself\"" it seems a tiresome formula that leaves us with the impression that this story could be better told in another way. Or worse\, it seems like a lazy movie.\n\nOf course looking at everything Marvel has built up so far\, making the Captain Marvel movie in this format was a well-calculated risk. The studio bet on the late novelty of having a female protagonist in a film of superheroes\, while it was overtaken by DC at this point\, which launched well before the Wonder WomanÂ´s movie. And the numbers multiplying every day in the cinemas\, show that Marvel\, at least from the economic point of view\, had made the right decision. We hope she now has the boldness to move on and make the Black WidowÂ´s movie\, so desired since \""The Avengers\"" (2012).\n\nHowever\, \""Captain Marvel\"" turns out to be a somewhat anodyne film. It has a confusing first part that refers to flashbacks to try to locate who is Carol Danvers\, a medium with a long rediscovery and accounts and an end that lacked the figure of a villain who really confronted her while she discovered the full potential of their powers. For a race of warriors\, however\, the Krees have given up very easily to face it only because it prevents some warheads from reaching the Earth.\n\nThe impression is that \""Captain Marvel\"" served more like a movie like \""Ant-Man and Wasp\"" (2018). While it located the viewer where Scott Lang was when Thanos snapped his fingers\, it served to give a fairly generalized overview of who Captain Marvel is before the inevitable confrontation with Thanos in \""Avengers: Endgame.\"" All the best seems to have stayed for an eventual second film. Especially the Kree-Skrull War.\n\nAbout Brie Larson\, the actress seemed to have been a wise choice for the role. She is a good actress who does not have great performance\, but has qualities for the development of the character from now on. And the partnership with Samuel L. Jackson worked well in the film. Let's see what it will be like now that she will insert herself into \""Avengers: Endgame\"".\n\nAnother positive point is the soundtrack. As \""Captain Marvel\"" takes place in the 90s\, the film brought a collection of hits from the decade with songs by Garbage\, No Doubt\, Nirvana\, R.E.M. It was a trip back in time and full of references to the decade\, from the Blockbuster network of movie theaters to Tarantino. But some songs seemed a bit out of place. It did not make much sense to \""Come as you are\"" while Carol confronted the Supreme Intelligence Kree.\n\n\""Captain Marvel\,\"" so got owed. It's ok fun\, but it looked like the best kept in store for the future.",True

I can tell you right now the only part you'll really like about this film is Nick Fury he is honestly the only reason this movie is three and a half stars every thing else in this movie was either way to bland like the sub characters or way to emotionless like the main character. one last thing alien cat is the best thing ever and i need a figure of it immediately.",True

196451,Captain Marvel,2019-04-24,4,"While I mostly feel just tired and bored with most Marvel movies\, with perhaps the exception of Thor Ragnarok\, Captain Marvel managed to keep me engaged. This new Cap is fun and it was interesting seeing her story unravel. It was fun seeing a less jaded Nick Fury and visit the 90's. Brie Larson had great chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson and it made me wish for more Captain Marvel romps through the 90's.\nSure this is another origin film\, but it feels fresh in a way Marvel hasn't felt in awhile. It made me excited about the MCU for the first time in a long time. Sure I loved TR but I didn't care what came after\, with Captain Marvel I really do care about Endgame.",True

Â«Captain MarvelÂ» has a few good poinÐµs like Samuel Jackson or catÐ±there are too much problems.

Nothing like that!\nBrie Larson wasnÂ´t even trying to act or the script didnÂ´t allow to. Carol Danvers is an emotioneless dry bone\, somethimes very annoying.

Despite tying up a few loose ends\, the film fell flat. In all honesty\, the best scenes were the post credit scenes\, the beginning (the Marvel pre screen)\, and the cameo. Other than that it felt slow\, disjointed\, and very small in relation to the rest of the MCU. I won't say it was the worst\, looking at you IronMan 3\, but it was in no way the best.

112232,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,"Captain Marvel is an incredible addition to the MCU\, and I feel it serves as a great launchpad for Carol Danvers. The visual effects are stunning\, and of particular note is the de-aging effect on both Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg\, which I found to be entirely believable.

This had potential but it dragged and fell short on story. Many of the jokes for me fell flat because Brie Larson wasn’t a great fit for the role. She lacked the charisma of Downey\, Hemsworth\, Boseman\, Johansson\, and other Marvel leads so far.

174196,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,The film is very well written. I want to see it again. Much of the âgender biasâ? that goes on in the movie is because of earthlings. The captain marvel character is solid and makes sense to the abuse sheâ(TM)s dealt with over six years. Look deeper.,True

I followed it and am very disappointed with Marvel/Disney and Rotten Tomatoes especially. Now let's talk about the movie... The positives\, great VFX\, great supporting characters\, Goose was great and had a different idea for plot. (But I do not feel it was executed properly. My personal opinion.) The negatives\, Brie Larson's performance fell flat at times (when she was performing good it was good! Must give credit where credit is due.)\, Jude Law's character was under used\, Captain Marvel not having any weakness or struggle in the closing fight\, battle\, whatever is a little disappointing and me personally feel connection to Carol as truly their was not much character development if we are being honest.

I thought the plot was an excellent addition to the Marvel universe and can’t wait for Avengers End Game. Brie Larson did an excellent job in what is an undoubtedly overly scrutinized role\, in which you simply can’t make everyone happy. Point blank. Any time you add the first female heroine to a franchise\, she will be put under undue scrutiny that the male heroes are not put under: is she too emotional or not emotional enough\, too strong or not strong enough\, too intelligent or too dumb\, too brash or too sweet\, too comedic or too serious? With all the male super heroes\, they can be anything\, and they aren’t scrutinized for what their character is because there are so many male characters. Iron Man is arrogant and comedic. Captain America is serious and stoic\, and somewhat monotone. Bruce is nerdy and somewhat scared at times\, the alter ego of Hulk. Thor is comedic and also arrogant. It all works\, and it’s not scrutinized because of their gender. They are allowed to be their own characters. It’s just a shame Captain Marvel can’t just be seen for the character she is without the over scrutiny due to her gender. It’s an excellent story and about time for a female hero to be added to the Marvel universe! You would think she would be welcomed with more open arms.",True

156708,Captain Marvel,2019-04-18,3,"Not a bad movie by any estimate. I think it suffers because Marvel has hit so many home runs lately\, and this was more of a double. I was sold a ground breaking Black Panther type experience\,  and purchased something closer to the standard Marvel origin films.  It reminded me a lot\, both good and bad\, of the first Thor movie.

127789,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,Honestly a pretty solid movie. Attended with a friend and my wife and we all were quite happy with it.\n\nAs many of said Goose and Fury stole the show. Talos was great as well. Danvers was solid and those complaining about Larson's unemotional acting seem to be missing the point that that was the character developing. It makes sense when you look at the background.\n\nI also feel that some may think she is too powerful but I think the issue is more that other heroes have had their powers downplayed from what the were in the comics. They did not do that to Captain Marvel for the MCU and it shows.\n\nSome cringy girl power moments but no where near enough to set my teeth on edge. I feel most of the negative ratings are more about what was said before the movie and not about the movie.,True

133575,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,1,I hate writing these things. But this movie is not very good.  If you think you are going to see Marvel's Wonder woman then you are mistaken.  Instead they are giving us a movie about a D level character that has very little personality.  B. Larson had all the emotion of Mr. Spock and that is not good.  The effects are good as usual but it takes more than good effects to make a good movie.,True
150825,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,5,Look I loved the movie. I thought the chemistry was instant between bree and sammy. The action was awesome the comedy was fantastic. Marvel knows what they are doing the movie was absolutely amazing. Thanos is in trouble with this addition to the avengers. Form your own opinions don't be a puppet. Thanks for your time.,True

186975,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,2,"This movie was so dull. cut out action set pieces\, uninspired characters\, weak storyline\, overpowered hero\, no emotion. Clunky exposition leads to a randomized 2nd act followed by a less than stellar third act. Not because of feminism\, but there's a solid undertone of it\, with subtlety. It's in the far bottom third of the Marvel universe and the overall saturation of the Marvel universe is beginning to show. Blank film.",True
122665,Captain Marvel,2019-09-07,0,Garbage i definitely don't recommend ,True
136562,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,4,"I'm going to break it to you straight\, I was part of the mob mentality of hating on this movie\, but then my grandfathers advice kicked in \""never be part of a mob\""\, why? Because once you get caught up in a mob you open yourself up to being influenced\, and needlessly hating will tear communities apart. I looked into the comics and what I discovered was baffling\, Captain Marvel in one of her stories acts as a criticism against pre-emptive strikes and the negative effects they have on society.. Which is exactly what I was seeing in this mob mentality.\n\nI'll get into the movie now.\n\n(Spoiler-ish)\n\nDo you need to watch this before Endgame? No.\n\nIs there Universe shattering plot points. No\, unless you have established head-canon.\n\nDoes Carol Danvers look bored all the time? No\, she's got a full range of emotions though the movie gives her reason to show restraint.\n\nIs Carol Danvers a douche or a bully a lot of the time? No\, she didn't particularly come off as douche-like to me.\n\nIs this movie feminist propaganda? No\, there's two scenes that collectively amount to about 10 seconds\, they're throw-away scenes\, they come towards the end of the movie\, one of them is a joke\, I wouldn't take them seriously though they kinda do take you out of the story for a second.\n\nDoes the movie have bad pacing? Sort of\, there's a couple of moments where Carol Danvers feels a bit too stoic\, the reason for this isn't clear\, I doubt that it's Brie Larsons fault because some of the opening shots have some extremely nuanced acting and is almost beautifully Ghost In The Shell inspired.\n\nIs Captain Marvel Overpowered? No\, though by the end she comes across as equally powerful as the original Avengers. Also we get to see that she's not used to fighting with her super powers and she makes mistakes while fighting. \n\nIs Captain Marvel a flawed character? Yes\, but it's difficult to see this because the movie doesn't emphasise them too well\, they're there\, but I think a general audience would have preferred these flaws be more pronounced.\n\nIs the story good and the pacing? This story is certainly unique from the rest of the MCU movies and when it comes to both story and pacing there are some really good scenes in here\, but again\, there are some slow ones that kinda drag on there's not many of them and they're short but they're still present in the movie and as minuscule as they are they impact the story and pacing\, also there are some really good and almost beautiful scenes in this movie\, there are about four\, they are really good and some of the highlights of the MCU but the story does also get a bit dumb at one point though it's sandwiched between two of the best scenes in the movie. It also gets a bit dumb at another point but that also leads into this scene that is absolutely fun.\n\nOverall is a good movie\, it's not bad\, I wouldn't blame someone for slipping on it though I recommended getting around to watching it at some point but I also want to say that most of the hate is undeserved.\n\nIt's about a 7/10 for me and at times I see the potential of an 8/10\, I wouldn't argue with someone who says it's a 5/10 for them\, that might just be up to personal taste\, but it's certainly not a bad movie and it's not a great movie. It's just good. And also fun at times. \n\nI'm considering seeing it again.",True

Its not really broken any new ground in terms of a super hero origin story\, and there's a twist with the villain you'll either love or hate\, but it's fast\, fun\, witty (in places) and has some pretty cool 90s nostalgia. Larson is convincing if not scene stealing and shares great chemistry with Jackson. Mendalsohn and Lynch are both superb with Ben in particular filling each of his scenes with charm and charisma. Overall\, highly entertaining and a great taster of what could be to come for the MCU. Don't believe any of this faux\, anti-feminist outrage. This film is no more anti-male than anything that's come before it.

Everytime she was fighting we knew she'd win\, the lead actress' acting was off\, and when se screams \""I'm human\"" there's no sense of victory bc she being human or kree (or whatever) never was an internal conflict. The only moment we could get to see a primary conflict being solved (when she is faced against her mentor) we instead get a joke.\n\nNo emotional investment in this movie\, only aliens whose powers we don't know the limitations therefore it's pointless to watch. \n\nNot worth the money\, should've watched Wonder Woman instead",True

It did the reverse of what a superhero movie should do. You are supposed to grow to like the character more as the film progresses\, but in this case\, it does the opposite.

I also thought Brie Larson was not the best actress they could have casted\, she fits the Captain Marvel image and I liked the look\, but her acting was not that great\, throughout the movie she had two emotions\, no emotion or anger.

I've been a fan of Carol Danver's character for a long time. Unfortunately what we got is a poorly written\, exceedingly obvious retcon that is an insult to fans of both the character and the rest of the MCU.\nThe other origin movies like Captain America and Iron Man show us a real origin and establish character\, taking a few creative liberties while attempting to stay true to the source material. We get to see how they develop\, what their motivations are\, what makes them heroic etc. Captain Marvel dives right into the more recent iteration of the character\, completely butchers and completely omits critical details of her history.  What this does is create a shallow\, mockery of a much more interesting hero. \nEven the title of \""Captain Marvel\"" has no substance because the name is an homage as well as an honor. But we don't get to see why because her progression is subverted. \nThe writers took a character that definately derserves a place in the MCU but chose to do such a horrible job that it feels forced and insincere. \nThe effects are great\, but making it flashy doesn't make up for the poor casting and sub par writing compared to other movies in the franchise.",True

112406,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,4,"Captain Marvel Is the new addition to the MCU\, a non-linear origin story of Carol Danvers AKA Ms Marvel AKA Princess Sparklefists AKA Captain Marvelâ¦â¦.. played by Brie Larson. \n\nThis is the first Marvel Studios origin film to feature a female superhero\, âno\, NOOOO waitâ¦ you waitâ¦. Not yetâ¦.. â and is also the unofficial âsetupâ? to Avengers: Engame film\, and explaining what in the hell is with the Pager?!\n\nCaptain Marvel has no memories of her past\, and is struggling to control her new unknown powers in the Kree Skrull War\, but when a chain of events leads her to discover her past wioth the help of a younger Nick Fury\, Captain Marvel must find out where she came from\, to become what sheâ(TM)s truly meant to be.\n\nThis film also introduces a new alien race of Skrulls\, that are shape-shifting aliens that can infiltrate and take over anywhere by turning into anyone they can see. The âKree Skrull warâ? was introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy and is the introduction to our world with Carol Danvers. \n\nThe story structure of this film is a âdeconstructionâ? of the origin film. Where typically you have your intro to the character\, inciting incident of powers\, the tests of their abilities\, struggles with the real world\, and so on\, Captain Marvel intentionally withholds information\, so that you learn about Carol danvers as she is learning about herself. This can be used really well and adds more mystery to the character\, but can be a very difficult tightrope to pull off if you have a lot to balance.\n\n So does Captain Marvel pull it off? â¦..eeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\nOk so the positives!!!! We all love positives!!!!\n\nThe 90â(TM)s setting is pretty fun to have included\, and they were able to accomplish some special effects feats with Clark Gregg and Samuel L Jackson as a younger Agent Coulson and âFuryâ?.\nTheir introduction to the movie was maybe one of my favorite parts because not only did they give their characters a âlethal Weaponâ? buddy cop vibe in a short amount of time that I was super into\, but the way the shot the entire sequence FELT like a 90â(TM)s movie which was a ton of fun.\n\nI liked the skrulls having practical effects done on them and also Ben Mendleson as the head Skrull. Annette Benning and Jude law are on the Kree side were pretty good performances overall. \n\nThe action and all the special effects on captain Marvel looked great\, her powerset is really fun to watch and see in action and yeah thanosâ¦ you gon get the shit kicked out of you here. \n\nBut and hereâ(TM)s where the comments come inâ¦ when I walked out of the theater I really didnâ(TM)t feel any attachment to Captain Marvel\, and might consider this to be one of the mid to lower teir marvel films in general.\n\nThe main issue is the story. I think Marvel took a bold shot at telling the story this way but it help Captain Marvel as a character for me to need to connect and relate to her. She doesnâ(TM)t really feel a part of the story and alot of times kind of drifts in and out with one liners and quips\, but thereâ(TM)s not enough time spent on her growing as a character and us exploring where she came from\, that she ends up being somewhat underdeveloped.\n\nThat is not taking anything away from Brie Larson as an Actress\, Room was fantastic and she is an oscar winner for a reason\, the story just doesnâ(TM)t build her character enough.\n\nThe story affects all of the characters actually\, Annette Benning and Jude Laws characters fall into the villain problem before we got Killmonger and Thanos\, because where we start with them we arenâ(TM)t given any time to mine the characters and develop what could be interesting\, but it all is super surface level. Same applies to Carols backstory where we arenâ(TM)t given much time to explore her backstory\, only from one scene that I really loved but it was just that one sceneâ¦ \n\nthe pacing is a little off for the first two acts\, the 3rd act is a visual spectacle and the effects on Captain Marvel are really cool\n\nOverall\, I feel Marvel missed the mark on this one. Captain Marvel is a big powerset in the MCU\, and hopefully in Avengers Endgame we get to see her as a fully fleshed out character\, but in the end when thinking of the over 10 years of the MCU\, I wish we had seen Captain Marvel introduced in a group film\, and we got the first female MCU film that we all deserveâ¦. We willâ¦. Later.. No not yet. Later!!!!!",True

142402,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,It's a one time watch. What kinda rubbed me the wrong way was - every super hero in the MCU - earned their way to whatever importance they currently hold in the grand scheme of things as far as the larger MCU plotlines go.

She will be better served with different production teams in future installments. Minor spoilers.. Talos gets the best character arc\, followed by Fury. The amnesia angle set up potential for two distinct characters- Carol and Vers. These characters needed to be literally \""worlds apart\"" before merging into something greater (aka Captain Marvel).

It's not epic but it's an origin story so it's not really meant to be.  The supporting characters were great but the Captain Marvel character felt flat and I think that's because she doesn't really go through a character arc and Brie Larson didn't really shine unless she was having emotional moments.

140102,Captain Marvel,2019-03-14,2,"Itâ(TM)s ok. Certainly some very entertaining moments\, but majoritively bland with a lacking character development. Sure\, a lot of things happen to her that are life changing\, but her personality remains the same throughout. She mostly just ends up getting more power by having the confidence to try harder. Once sheâ(TM)s is unbeatably powerful\, she has a new found confidence. Thatâ(TM)s not real development because what fear is there to conquer once you punch a few spaceships out of existence and lazer cannon fire is bouncing off your chest. No need to get into the controversial aspects of the film as they can be summed up as distracting; whether regarding critics and propaganda beforehand\, or story devices and writing in the actual film. Distracting throughout. If this had come out in phase one (which is no disservice to some of those great films)\, Iâ(TM)d be giving it a B with added concern about the direction of the MCU as a whole. Iâ(TM)d be lacking excitement for the future as this film disregards many aspects of the various Captain Marvel storylines in Marvel Comics and fails to delve into more interesting\, cheaply teased references. Itâ(TM)s as if they know what the MCU empire was built upon\, but they are choosing to use it as cinematic âclickbaitâ?. I fail to see the purpose of getting comic fans excited to see the great stories that have been hinted\, only to let down their hopes and give them something unfamiliar. The MCU was built on comic geek feeling that Kevin Feige and co. had finally figured out how to tweek comics just enough to where they worked on the big screen\, but also did poetic justice to their original content. Those geeks\, like myself\, force friends and family alike to come see these films with them...and it slowly took hold. Finally\, a medium that made comics digestible for the general audience\, and praise Oden\, they lifelong comic fans finally would see their favorite stories on the big screen. This film simply fails to be an universally satisfying. As a stand alone film Captain Marvel is averagely entertaining\, not a waste of the ticket price\, and even holds its own if within MCU phase 1 - minus the lacking ode to the comics. But by todayâ(TM)s MCU standards I rate it at 2.5/5 stars. That being said\, it was scarcely close to being a top heir Marvel movie. Hard to say whether improving acting or writing would have the greatest benefit to the poor character development. Whatâ(TM)s more certain is that if aspects that make it controversial are replaced with original content\, weâ(TM)d have a much better film. The Captain Marvel from the comics is already written as an amazing\, influential\, and imposing female character whom no other character would even begin to doubt or take lightly. The film unfortunately fails in this respect as it feels the need to directly tell us how we are supposed to see her rather than simply showing us through how she responds to plot devices. Itâ(TM)s good enough to where Iâ(TM)ll watch it again as I do all Marvel films\, but Iâ(TM)ll be playing on my phone and only look up when she is kicking some butt. Final Score : 2.5/5",True

One of the major problems in this movie is there was nothing happening that really made me question the safety of the protagonist.

148973,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,Kind of just a really boring passable superhero movie. Main character was kinda two dimensional. Not a lot about it was super emotionally compelling. I feel like they tried to have this strong female character but they did so by making her stoic and kind of snarky instead of having a compelling physical or emotional obstacle for her to overcome and in turn be regarded as a strong character. I hate to say this but the movieâ(TM)s explicitly feminist agenda got in its way rather than helped construct a relatable and interesting female superhero. Black widow shouldâ(TM)ve gotten a movie before captain marvel. Also a lot of this movie was really heavy handed. 90s references were forced. There was this part where younger versions of captain marvel stand up and look directly into the camera in this really overdramatized way as a way of making it look like sheâ(TM)s overcoming some huge obstacle but itâ(TM)s so forced and so awkward and it doesnâ(TM)t work. Not everything is terrible though. Samuel l Jackson is great. The one green homie was cool. But the bad outweigh the good to me.

I've seen Brie Larson in a few other movies and I think she's a pretty good actor\, but in this movie I didn't care for her performance. I know she can do a good job so I don't know if it's the directing or the writing\, but her performance was pretty bland. I didn't really feel anything from her character at any point during the movie. Most of the other actors were just ok. Even Samuel L. Jackson wasn't as awesome as he normally is\, but he still did a good job. Lashana Lynch did a pretty good job too\, but sadly she wasn't in the movie that much. There was only one actor who did an awesome job and that was Ben Mendelsohn as Talos. He did a great job and was by far my favorite character in the movie. The Skrulls were the best part of the movie which shouldn't have been the case because they're supposed to be the bad guys and the main character and hero should have been the best part. The action was honestly pretty weak. There was no part in this movie where it felt like there was any great danger for anyone. The best parts about this movie were funny the funny ones. The humor is what made me like this movie because the other aspects of the movie were lacking. Overall this movie was a little better than just ok. It's definitely not the worst Marvel movie\, but it is far from my favorite. I will still buy the movie when it comes out because I want to own all of the MCU movies\, but I feel that they could have made this movie much better than what we got.",True
173675,Captain Marvel,2019-03-17,3,"The character arc for Talos was exceptional\, so the screenwriters are definitely capable of writing interesting characters. So I guess they just chose to make the title character boring and uninspired.",True
147421,Captain Marvel,2019-05-06,5,"I went to watch the movie\, without seeing anything of the internet. I found it very entertaining and felt powerful with her. It's really nice to see a woman being a hero sometimes ... I started thinking about Marvel's heroines and I remembered the black widow ... but on second thought\, she does not have her own film\, she's always making small appearances in the movies of the other heroes.\nI was sad to know that everyone was criticizing the film when it gave me a good feeling\, about overcoming\, that being human is to raise a thousand times and more.",True

I'm a real viewer and real fan of the MCU. That's all\, plan and simple. Thank you all for your hard work. I really loved the way the made Samuel younger.

Did we get all of her powers and her maximizing the use of them?  No.  But consider how much crazier Iron Man or Captain America was in their second or third movies.  The kind of stuff they pulled puts their original appearances to shame.  I\, for one\, am looking forward to Captain Marvel joining the larger MCU and what she has to offer.",True
196436,Captain Marvel,2019-10-05,2,"While I don't think the movie was terrible I was very disappointed. Bland directing\, generic story\, and a surprisingly very poor performance by Brie Larson. Was expecting more from Marvel. 4/10",True

141247,Captain Marvel,2019-04-07,3,I thought the movie was great there was a few parts that dragged out because they left you wanting to no who she really was and what she was about based on the movies storyline. And it became tiresome up until halfway through and then the movie bloomed and was fantastic!! I get that they have to explain her character before things truly go down but to me the first half of the movie really wasn’t doing that justice it just was going but no true depth so I give it 3 stars because of the second half of the movie. It was awesome and I know that the next time we see her with all her power and glory she will be kicking ass. But on a side note I feel like the supporting characters gave the movie its heartbeat she needs to spice up her personality for part 2 ,True
169304,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,"SPOILER FREE: \nI went in to this movie with neutral expectations. Carol as Captain Marvel is one of my favorite comic book characters; I'd already had one of my cherished childhood books turned into a travesty of an unnecessary trilogy (ahem\, The Hobbit). This movie was so much fun. I appreciate the way character and plot points from the comics were interpreted to the big screen\, Brie Larson was a fantastic casting choice for Carol\, and I could feel mamma shark Kelly Sue DeConnick's guiding hand. I couldn't stop smiling\, including during one emotional moment when I also cried. Well done Marvel.",True

131766,Captain Marvel,2019-04-02,0,"I feel its more or less a cop out. As in they have these amazing female superhero like Scarlet Witch and Black Widow both amazing characters\, with Scarlet Witch set to be one of the most powerful beings on every to live and they go and undercut all this with captain marvel.

I would only only recommend this movie if some one rents it and you have nothing better to do for the next to hours.",True
153808,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,3,"Middle of the road Marvel fare. Larson doesn't really pop off the screen like RDJ\, Chris Pratt or most all of the Marvel actors before her.

Okay\, but not great.",True

187322,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,This one ranked on the bottom end for me of all the Marvel movies. Many Narvel movies to me are worth watching twice or even more but this was a one and done for me. Brie Larson didn't sell me the character. Her acting and emotions throughout the movie just weren't there.,True
183557,Captain Marvel,2019-06-24,2,This movie brought nothing new to the MCU. Sure it was the first female lead superhero movie. But there was no strong storyline. There was no epic new fight scene nor was barely any continuity within the MCU. And before I get crucified I find nothing wrong with female lead movies; look at Wonder Woman. By far the best DCEU movie to date(obviously in my opinion).\n\nThe hype to this movie was contributed by the fact people all around the world insisted you needed to watch this before end game because it was an important segment of the MCU. I don't believe it was necessarily a must watch to understand what was happening as she wasn't featured for very long in end game,True

180750,Captain Marvel,2019-03-22,2,"This entire movie was filled with an overdose of Hollywood violence. 90% of the movie involved filings. The main character\, ms Marvel was tied up with ropes and machines and tortured in order to extract information from her brain. There are demonic looking characters that chase her throughout the movie and then she befriends them. Its hard to switch an evil character that looks like the devil into a \""good guy\"". The story seem to be good with some morals\, but the entire movie was saturated with violence\, that it took away from the plot.",True
111005,Captain Marvel,2019-03-18,2,Brie Larson gave a terrible performance. Cat was funny. Retcons were terrible. Plot twist didn't benefit the movie. Very bland plot. Would give a 6 but it doesn't deserve a positive rating.,True

In the climax of the film\, she goes from extremely powerful to way too powerful with the only learning curve for the character being to accept and embrace her emotions. No two characters spend enough time together on-screen for me\, as a viewer\, to feel any form of bond or chemistry between them or to care when things take a turn for the worse in their relationship. I did like the action sequences and some of the supporting cast\, specially Ben Mendelsohn's character. The film also  plays with the idea of how one can be manipulated into perceiving something or someone as good or evil\, which I liked\, but its never fully explored. And finally\, Nick Fury\, what did they do with thy eye !!!",True

It suffered a bit like Age of Ultron in that regard.",True

That being said dows at times Brie Larson feels like a Phase one Thor\,  where she just needs a couple movies to find her perfect character. This great version of Carol Danvers shines by the end of the film and should be fine tuned by Avengers: Endgame. That being said the supporting cast more than makes up for any flaws in the titular characters characterization. Sam Jackson falls into this diffrent take if Nick Fury beautifully and Ben Mendelson's Talos steals the show. The plot strains at times\, but adds a few clever twists to the Marvel formula to stand out from the lesser MCU films.  A notch about Antman and the Wasp\, but a couple short of Infinity War. All and all Captain Marvel is another fine additon to this universe that is much better than the marketing suggests.",True
154842,Captain Marvel,2019-03-16,2,Movie was very predictable with the exception of an out-of-place song during a fight scene and Nick Fury being turned into comic relief.,True
193841,Captain Marvel,2019-03-25,1,Was this film highly anticipated? Yes it was. Did it deliver the goods? Not really.\n\nCaptain marvel began with a very good beginning but began to become dry half way and the main character barely had any emotions. Reminded of the main character of twilight... It just lacked what a traditional marvel movie has and was probably one of the worst marvel films in this cinematic universe.\n\nWhen I look at a good female lead superhero film I look at wonder woman. Now that's how a movie should be not this lack luster title.,True
174110,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"The film captures the feel of the old late 80s early nineties action films. The film basically sets up the whole MCU.  A little slow in the beginning \, the last 40 minutes is  fun. Goose and Fury steal the show. The 2 end credits scenes are worth staying for.",True

176716,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,The movie is meh the fish out of water story line just didn't work. it didn't let me fell anything for Captan Marvel. It's really a shame cause it's at the bottom with Antman and the Wasp 2. For a super hero movie the fighting is non existent and forgettable.,True
111157,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"Brie larson wasn't the best casting decision. Her acting is extremely rigid and unnatural. The movie had to be carried by the rest of the cast in a lot of ways. Choppy action scenes and mediocre story also didn't help. Even when judged by the more simple minded standards of super hero movies\, mainly how fun it is\, captain marvel falls flat on its face. I really hope endgame pushes this whole storyline away or at least they recast the character.",True
120976,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,1,"Film was predictable and therefore boring. No risks were taken\, especially with character geowth (for which there was none). Its become tiring to see the same story beats hit upon again amd again in origin movies.",True

105253,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,2,"As a Marvel movie is medicore at best. Male roles were quite good - and performed nicely - altho they went a bit overboard with youth effects on Jackson etc. There are quite a few plot holes or things that doesnt make any sense in the flow of the movie (aka the main charakter just learns to fly and its not explaine why). As characters go the main one is a plain Example of Mary Sue syndrome - literally she has nothing to strive for there are no real obstacles to overcome - and the struggle to overcome characters own deficiencies or faults is the main driving force in hero movies - so ya this alone kills it pretty badly. Usually Marvel movies used to induce - \""i want to see that movie\"" again response - this one is just meh - you can see it once and forget about it. so yah medicore at best   and propaganda tool at worst (ive counted at least 17 feminism related narratives).",True

Any person who gives this a review condemning Larson's performance or angry it wasn't some other person shouldn't be allowed to voice their critique. The movie is the origin of Captain Marvel\, it is the introduction of who she is into the already loaded stage of heroes. You can't expect the origin story to come out guns blazing. This story gave is some real perspective on who Captain Marvel will be as a new player on the field and her personal stake in the dilemma. It is a powerful voice as well\, being a hero in her own right with nothing to prove. I thoroughly loved this movie and I look forward to seeing the progression of Captain Marvel/Carol Dancers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",True

What a **** show and now we're stuck with it... I feel like the pitch for this movie\, and what the draw for the audience was ment to be\, is purely the fact that its a female led superhero movie for the MCU. Talk about filling the roll in the worst way possible. I'm all for female superheros but I'm not gonna pretend this movie was good just so marvel can say they have a \""good\"" female lead... movie was vanilla at best.

143545,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,It started off very slow and kind of boring the first 20 minutes. That could have been improved. Got much better when fury was introduced into the show. The scrolls were pretty good. The ending was good as well. Had lots of dry humor and 90s in it which made it funny. Liked how some guardians of the galaxy people were in it.

181572,Captain Marvel,2019-03-28,2,This is a decent movie. Not great but good. A little stiff and leans on Sam L. a little much. Ms. Larson's talent is obvious but the movie does not use her strengths enough.  When they try to make her funny it just doesn't work.

140525,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,4,"I think all the poor reviews are baseless. This was an iconic movie and a massive win for a female lead. Young Fury was outstanding and the realism of everything was on point. No massive buildings being busted or the city getting turned into rubble like in many other movies. It was straight acting and execution of a story about a character who is seeking to find herself\, and overcome internal conflict. The movie really hits hard on the importance of perseverance and doing what is right vs just being a hero. I would highly recommend this movie and am proud to say this is easily in the top 3 of marvel movies over the last 5 years or so.

It’s definitely not the bet mcu installment but it’s definitely not the worst.",True
183666,Captain Marvel,2019-03-15,5,"This movie despite what people might say in the reviews\, is not boring at all. In fact this movie is the opposite of that\, it has plenty of action scenes and Larson was brilliantly funny\, especially the scenes with Nick Fury and Captain Marvel.

105188,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,0,As a longtime and avid comic book reader I can honestly say this is the worst superhero movie I have ever seen. Absolute garbage-tier writing. Don't waste your time or money on this one folks.,True

It's not my favorite Marvel movie\, but it certainly isn't the worst. I think the people who prejudged the movie based their complaints on other movies\, or ideas about what this movie was supposed to be\, or what the character was supposed to be\, or what this female character should be like compared to all the other female characters out there. If you can leave all that at the door\, you might just enjoy this movie. I'd give it a B- as a Marvel movie.

Ben Mendelsohn (Talos) and Lashana Lynch (Maria Rambeau) were great in supporting roles. Definitely in my top 3 from Marvel (Captain America First Avenger\, Captain Marvel\, Winter Soldier)\, and I rate it slightly above Wonder Woman as female led role in super hero film. Also a great soundtrack of late 80’s early 90’s music fit well\, especially No Doubt “Just A Girl” for the fight sequence against the Kree. I think Brie Larson was an excellent fit for the movie. Well Done.",True

134009,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,I have to give props fo Marvel taking the mystery option on this film and coming hard with the alien tech mumbo jumbo. If you ver read Captain Marvel comics you know that's essentially what Captain Marvel is all about. I'm also happy to see some old bad guys pop up. The negatives even with the twists the movie does feel very formulaic. Also I think they were hitting the but she's just a girl button way too much. But I love how this movie waters your palette for endgame and props to all the grungy 90's music. They did not shy away from that at all.

For an origin story the movie took a fresh approach by letting us discover her story at the same time is Carol herself.

Brisk\, not overly laden with exposition\, action packed\, and fairly earnest. I feel that the worst transgression by far was (what seemed to me\, anyway) the attempt to mimic the humor and musicality of Guardians of the Galaxy. That felt like the LEAST genuine part of the movie for me. it's not that the jokes or the music were bad\, they just felt like too much of an obvious grab for the GotG vibe. Despite this minor complaint\, I enjoyed the movie. A friend of mine points out\, however\, that now Captain Marvel has become so powerful that she'll have the classic Superman problem. AKA too strong to write anything compelling. Well\, I still like Superman a lot and I've read and watched plenty of compelling stories about him\, so I dont think it is that big of a deal.

Jackson had good chemistry throughout and their scenes together were enjoyable. Unfortunately the 2nd third of the movie was very slow and uneventful. But my biggest issue with the movie was the unnecessary tie ins with other movies in the MCU. Without giving too much away\, we learn things that (one) nobody was asking for\, and (two) the answers are more of a disservice and disrespectful to fans of both the comics and MCU as a whole. The source of Captain Marvel's power seems to break the timeline of an important item in the MCU and there's little to no character arc in her story. This would have been a great movie if it was by itself. But because of it's influence on a greater universe of connected movies\, it made me more upset at betrayed than entertained.",True

Politics aside\, this movie just fell flat. Brie Larson gave what is possibly the worst performance of any marvel superhero film. Her character never encountered a challenge that she didn’t immediately and easily overcome. Sam Jackson’s Nick Fury was only included for comedic purposes\, which is a missed opportunity for him to get more time in the spotlight. The really only enjoyable part of the movie for me was when Captain Marvel flies for the first time. I do not usually promote not seeing a movie\, but this one is rather useless in the larger scope of Avengers: Endgame. Save yourself some money and just look up the post credits online.",True

No. However\, it’s funny\, the script is mostly smart\, and seeing Samuel Jackson de-aged was a treat. There’s surprises\, 90’s nostalgia\, big action\, and clever tie-ins to the other movies. Brie Larson’s character might have had a bit more heart compared to other stellar Marvel characters\, but she still did quite well. I think they wanted to to be more military in demeanor.

106437,Captain Marvel,2019-03-19,2,"A tribute to brawn over brains.\n\nSo finally saw the movie last night..\nHad my hopes and expectations set to very low.. (Usually helps)\nHowever this movie was very.. Bland..\n\nLets start with the things i did like.\n\nMost of the side characters where actually decent. Some where already known others where new\, none of them explored very much but at least you got an impression about who they where.\n\nTalos and Fury both where decent and Fury did a lot of wisecracking a good deal of which was quite fun. Talos in general i liked\, calm thoughtful and with more than 2 dimensions.\n\nNow for the rest.\n\nThe thing that pissed me off most of all is quite common in movies\, and its the inconsistencies..\nWe see quite early that tho not at her full power yet she is clearly a lot stronger than the norm\, breaking a metal frame that she is locked in.. Skrulls are weaker than her\, the big one apparently is stronger tho.. Yet when we get to earth we see a Skrull wrestle with Fury for grip on a gun\, how did it not simply take it from him ? We see 2 humans grab CM and hold her for a moment while she is attempting to attack a skrull.. With strengt like hers they would have no effect yet they hold her back.. I know this might seem like rambling.. But ffs make up your mind is she super strong or not ? And same would go for the skrulls..\n\nThen thereï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s the Superman effect.. Nothing quite makes for a boring superhero movie than one where our hero is not challenged.. Basically CM is superman with the absence of kryptonite.. If the villain does not challenge the hero there is no struggle.. So what then are we watching ?.. Its much like the ending of JL\, superman arrives and its game over for the bad guy.. Weee how fun..\n\nThe main character does in no way pull me in.. I donï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t care about her what she does and why\, a lot of it can be put on the Superman effect i posted above\, but thatï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s not the only reason. I donï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t know weather or not its the script or Bries acting but the character is so unlikeable\, from the stone faces grimace that does not look badass but just annoyingly sour\, to the lack of charm\, personality and humor\, everything about her just bored me.\nEven when we where supposed to watch these buddy buddy scenes between MC and Fury\, it just seemed so damned forced more than anything.\nI caught myself sitting and thinking i actually cared more for the bad guy henchman Minn-Evrr or whatever her name was.. She had more personality than our main character.. A character with about 5 min. screen time.. I had more insight into her at this point than i did to our main character\, her loyalties\, her disliking CM which seemed obvious from early on. Its pretty bad when 5 min. screen time gives more about a character than a 2h movie does about the main character.\nThe main character is also as my title says a tribute to brawn over brains\, she acts like an idiot quite a few times\, yet it donï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t matter as she can just wave her hands around and it wont matter..\n\nStory is somewhat acceptable\, not like we did not see who was the bad guy from the start of the movie\, but oh well what a twist big big surprise. Mistakes like the S.H.I.E.L.D. name did not help. Thereï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s also quite a lot of great and well known music from the 90ï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s.. Yet it was just soï¿ 1/2 1/2 Poorly chosen..\n\nAll in all i felt like i tried overly to not be annoyed at dumb things in the movie..\nI rated it 2/5.",True

However this movie is just another installment in a greater franchise and it's felt throughout the film. With constant reminders to the bigger MCU this movie tries to stand alone but ultimately just leaves you spending most of your time wondering where Carol has been for all these years. The character of Fury changes a lot in this movie. We learn his rough grisled exterior Is a lie. He loses his eye in a way that undercuts Jackson's earlier performances and in my personal opinion lessens the character of fury.

And after watching the whole film\, CM has become my most favorite superhero next to Thor!\n\nMoreover\, contrary to what the haters/bashers say where they review first before watching the whole film simply by basing their review from their co-haters' opinion\, Brie Larson fit the role of Captain Marvel.  After seeing the way she speaks or carrying herself and what she stands for\, I say\, she is definitely perfect for the role. She's got some dry sense of humor and so is Carol Danvers.  So whenever I see her during interviews\, there's only a minimal difference between Brie Larson and Captain Marvel minus the superpowers.

You can’t be dull and wooden and then let off a laugh and a smile and expect me to believe that. The movie did have some funny parts and I like some of the developments with the story. I hope some other directors can bring out a much stronger performance because she has already proven herself to be a dope actress. That’s a big part of why her performance in this bothered me so much. Like c’mon Brie\, you KNOW you can do better than this. But her character had basically no development.

Brie Larson does great as Carol\, and even if nothing made me tear up with her story (even when I felt like I should've)\, I came out the other end of my viewing liking her.

I'm sure if she'd done more the complaint would be she was \""over the top.\""\n\nSupporting cast was also great\, Samuel L. Jackson is just so much fun to watch\, especially to see him play the same character at a much earlier point in his life.

187957,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,This was a tough movie to review. \n\nI enjoyed every moment of it but it felt jarring in its pacing. The beginning of the films holds back Carol Danvers and we get Veers who is an empty shell...literally. Once Carol comes in she becomes instantly likable.

161247,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"Overall an ok movie but doesn't meet the high standards already set by Marvel. \nBrie Larson was ok. She started actually being engaging during her training phase alongside Jude Law. She started with charasmatic performance with humour\, but this performance turned very wooden very quickly. \nSamuel L. Jackson was the best performer by far\, but this movies plot/writing has ruined his character. Fury was the 'head honcho' of Shield and Avengers who had presence and weight\, but here he is portrayed as being inspired by Captain Marvel even tho she didn't earn that level of adoration whatsoever. Also\, how Fury lost his eye was pathetic and disrespectful to his character. He is shown cowaring holding a cat during a gunfight which annoyed me because it's just not a true representation of Nick Fury at all.\n\nCaptain Marvel / Carol Danvers\, although showing potential at first\, shown zero character development or significant arc\, she remains unjustly cocky throughout and unengaging for most of movie and ridiculously overpowered for no real reason other than she 'absorbed' an explosion and inherited these powers for no logical reason.\n\nMCU plot holes annoyed me too. The Tesaract had already being established as being with Shield\, so why does the scientist woman have it to experiment with ??? Makes no sense and disrespects the stories of previous MCU movies.\n\n      Overall a decent movie\, fantastic CGI with de-aging effects but deffinetly not rewatching or buying on Blu-Ray.",True

While it's definitely not my favorite Marvel film\, I think they did a great job of introducing Carol Danvers to the MCU\, presenting a fun and action-packed take on the traditional origin story\, and bringing in the Skrulls in a unique way that I surely wasn't expecting. I think Brie Larson did great\, though the script and story often didn't give her enough space to stand on her own as the lead\, and I think Ben Mendelssohn was just unbelievably good as Talos. It also sets the groundwork for more pre-MCU storytelling that'll allow for some epic space battles and exploration.",True

She just came across as bland with no character arc.\n\nThe movie basically had no Central message other that what we were told before the movie itself came out. However\, the movie didn't do anything to solidify that at all. It barely expanded on anything with a very weak\, cookie cutter storyline. This movie seems to be just a cash grab designed to make a quick buck before Avengers: End Game comes out.

The first 10 minutes or so are a bit of mess\, the middle has some good moments followed by a way over the top final act with unnecessary music. More could have and should have been done to make this a more balanced film. All the ingredients were there. Yes there was a certain element of over the top feminist tones and I hope that is pulled back in future (I'm surprise that Destinys Child - Survivor didn't get a song play) but in terms of the future MCU let's not forget that Thor 1 and 2 were pretty lame and arguably Iron Man 2 but those characters have still shone through over the general course of things. Thinking again\, a lot of the origin stories barring the odd one haven't been amazing.

Carol Danvers in the comics was a straight to the point character\, so Ms. Larson did well. no complaints on the acting. The Mar Vell character in the movie was a terrible disservice to the comics. In the comics Mar Vell was an intelligent military mind\, genius level on earth\, but not a full blown scientist of his species and the comic version death of Mar Vell was truly iconic. The movie version was a cheat. The man bashing was definitely there. It would be nice if politics was left out of entertainment. But the truly terrible thing is what was done with the skrulls.

This movie is not worth the hype that Marvel and Disney want you to believe it is. You can always tell when a director or movie studio want you to believe that a movie is more important and epic than it really is. The cat was the best part! ",True
122574,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,"Fun origin story that doesn't avoid the risks involved in \""controversial\"" positions\, but embraces them in unison with the titular character's own journey and development.\n\nWhile a necessary step in the inclusion of this character for the upcoming avengers title\, it stands on it's own as a joyful representation within the universe of comics that on occasion lags behind the rest of society.\n\nRather than interpreting the way the film bolsters the voices of those often held back or controlled as a contrived matter\, it felt symbiotic to providing context with the first female title character in the MCU. Even potentially cliche responses by Captain Marvel in dialogue based on the current societal conversation on gender equality felt crafted in a way to benefit the scene\, rather than detract.\n\nOverall\, the movie serves dual purpose to provide introduction to the MCU for Captain Marvel prior to pivotal interactions in an upcoming movie that is undoubtedly going to be crammed pack and ripe for editing woes\, as well as an unapologetic declaration regarding the ongoing societal conversations with respect to gender. The retrospective does not hold back with regards to 90's woes on that front\, weaving a framework of things \""hiding in plain sight\"" between both the literal plot line characters\, and the reality of society then and now suffering from contemporary and historical blind-spots.\n\nWell worth a watch for any comic and MCU fan\, but doubly so for anyone hungry for an expansive universe where sons AND daughters are provided the encouragement for breaking through barriers and past pre-conceptions of what we are\, or what we should be.",True

The characters seemed well cast (Ben Mendelsohn stands out)\, the acting is mostly good (Brie Larson seems hit or miss throughout)\, and the effects are solid (youthful CGI looks given to Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg are fun).

118014,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,3,"Enjoyable enough. She is a great character for little girls and there is nothing wrong with that at all. Brie Larson may not be the grinning hero people expect but I liked her attitude\, wit\, and sarcasm. The play between her and Sam Jackson almost had a Lethal Weapon-type vibe to it which was great to see. The first 3/4 of the film was definitely the strongest and I enjoyed seeing the two of them on the hunt for answers. On the downside\, they could have left the man-hate jokes out of it. I get it’s cool and trendy to hate men now but the Nick Fury “Human Male Threat Zero to None” was actually pretty insulting and too on the nose (they DO realize half the audience is in fact both human and male?). There were a couple other parts like that but easy enough to ignore and just enjoy the movie (sticks and stones\, right?). Villains were confusing\, didn’t really understand their motivation in the end. Plot\, themes\, and even the characters were VERY similar to Green Lantern...felt like I had seen the movie before. Hell even the costumes looked very close. In the end I would say I enjoyed it as much as the other Marvel films...it was a good popcorn flick but suffers from shoehorning political statements of our time\, and that will probably become more apparent in this film as it ages. Should leave those sort of statements to The X-Men\, they are more suited for such themes. Still\, grab your daughter/niece/sister/mother or whoever and take them to see it\, then maybe they will see why we all loved action comic heroes growing up. Looking forward to Endgame. ",True

146966,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,2,"I was stoked to hear Captain Marvel\, a woman was going to be the strongest Avenger!  When the trailer came out\, I watched it as soon as it dropped.  And was immediately dissatisfied.  Brie Larson felt so flat.  âWell\, itâ(TM)s just a trailer.  Maybe the way itâ(TM)s cut together just isnâ(TM)t doing much for you.â?  So the next trailer comes out.  Zero improvement.  Not to be discouraged though\, I shove all of my misgivings over possible bad casting aside.  Finally\, opening weekend!  I enter the theater ready to be energized and empowered.  I walked out unmoved.  Iâ(TM)m not evening going to go into choppy fight scenes and disjointed score/soundtrack (great songs\, just awkward transitioning).  I never saw Captain Marvel\, I just saw Brie Larson blandly delivering her lines.  Iâ(TM)ve seen more believable deliveries from high school plays.  She never made me believe.  Lines that shouldâ(TM)ve displayed the perfect mix of cockiness\, fearlessness\, and wit became merely cheesy\, sometime bordering on cringey.  A CGI cat/flurkin was more capable of humor than Larson as Captain Marvel.  Not once did she make me care about her struggles\, partly because she never conveyed that they were actually a struggle for herself. \n\nIâ(TM)m giving this film a middle rating because as unbelievable Larson was\, the rest of the cast sold me on it.  Both Fury and the Skrull general got several chuckles from me\, and Marie displayed emotional depth despite more awkward dialogue.  The Stan Lee tribute made me feel more (choked up a bit) then the climax of the film\, and the Dark Phoenix trailer beforehand had me more engaged and emotionally invested than the entire film put together (Sophie Turnerâ(TM)s sobs at the beginning choke me up every. single. time.).

112527,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,"Captain Marvel was a festival like experience. I was hyperventilating every time Brie Larson lit up. There are a lot of moments that evoke goosebumps and\, the film also generates good humour. Carol Danvers is a decisive woman who is on a path of self-discovery with young Nick Fury. Sadly\, there is very little information about her past. It's like they shrunk her past in a few memory flashes. I want the future MCU to add more layers to her character arc because it would be terrible to see the strongest avenger as a stoic full-time resilient female lead. The 90s setting\, soundtracks and visual effects are impressive.\nAlso\, Marvel pays a great tribute to Stan Lee through a Stan Leefied logo and a very special cameo. Goose shares some splendid moments with the very charismatic Samuel L Jackson.\nThen there is the mid-credit scene which almost gave me a heart attack",True
183846,Captain Marvel,2019-04-10,2,"This movie feels out of place. We have been through 10 years of Marvel movies all leading up to Endgame\, and this new character parachutes in 2 months before the big finale. \nThe other Avengers all went through incredible sacrifice and had to reinvent themselves. Stark was the self centered jerk that changed when he got a chest full of shrapnel and saw his weapons used by the bad guys. Thor was completely stripped of his power and cast out of Asgard. Captain America was the skinny kid who got the super serum\, but shortly after went down for a 70 year nap in the ice. \n\nCaptain Marvel doesn't have such an interesting story. Her big challenge was apparently overcoming people trying to hold her back because she is a woman. She is never really shown weakened\, lacking her true powers\, or having to figure out who she is separate from her powers as has been the case for all of the other characters. Her acting didn't really help\, but I think that was mostly because of the script\, not because Brie isn't capable of a better performance. \nI suspect we will see her get smacked down early in Endgame and have to find herself and a way to overcome her newly found lack of invincibility. \nRealistically\, we haven't even seen Thanos at full strength. He didn't bother killing all of the heroes in Infinity War because he didn't see them as a big enough threat to be worth killing\, except Stark who he went out of his way to kill until Dr. Strange intervened. \n\nI think Captain Marvel will grow on me in future movies\, but her introduction was just clunky and felt like it was shoved into place rather than belonging 2 months before Endgame.",True

196019,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"When a CGI'd cat that I wasn't sure was even there half the time has more character development and charisma than the main protagonist you know there's a problem. Honestly the only reason this movie doesn't get an outright one star is the side cast. Jackson gets to play an old school cop like character and shows the audience that he's got a detective's intuition and is strong in the face of danger\, i.e. when the Skrull assume the form of Fury's boss and refers to him as Nicholas instead of Fury (a reference to how he's referred to by EVERYBODY in the previous scene) was pretty neat. Maria (AMAZING CHARACTER\, shame I had to Google the name since they only say it once) was a fun character that showed her skills as a pilot throughout the film and her dedication to her friends and family was awesome\, sassy and badass done right. The skrull showed the problems with kree imperialism. \n\nNotice a pattern here? The side characters SHOWED their worth to the story. Carol Danvers aka Vers aka Captain Marvel does not. She has about as much character development as a Hot Pocket\, and we're not given a sense of peril and struggle throughout the film\, she's just a generic Mary Sue with Deus Ex Machina powers that overcomes the odds with the force of...I don't even know. And that's the problem! Honestly if you take Danvers out of the picture and just have the squad of Fury\, Maria\, Talos\, and Goose the Cat on wild adventures you'd have a badass movie.

112666,Captain Marvel,2019-03-19,5,"Captain Marvel was your basic superhero movie\, filled with fast action and well performed stunts. However\, setting this movie apart from all the others is the quick wit humor and amazing cast. Brie Larson gives an empowering performance playing Captain Marvel in this 90s nostalgia filled adventure. Captain Marvel finds herself caught in the middle of an intergalactic battle between her people\, the Kree\, and the shape-shifting Skrulls who are trying to invade Earth. With help from Nick Fury (played by Pulp Fiction era Samuel L. Jackson thanks to special effects) she tries to save the Earth while uncovering secrets of her past that come back to her in dreams as recurring memories of another life as a U.S. Air Force pilot\, Carol Danvers. The movie\, while important for female empowerment (being the first main female hero movie in the MCU)\, is also a great metaphor and comment on our war torn world right now and refugees who are forced to find a new home while being viewed as the enemy. Also setting this movie apart is the lack of romance\, instead choosing to focus on characterization and growth\, as well as familial and platonic relationships.  Also Reggie the cat as Goose was amazing. He showed pure talent and put on a show-stopping performance.

The period work was actually quite good\, none of the strange little flaws like in some of the other MCU movies where they do things like mess up license plate colors for the state they are supposed to be in. Enjoyed all the performances as well as the SFX and the plot moved well right to the end. Can't wait to get the 3D Blu Ray when it is available.",True

164783,Captain Marvel,2019-03-08,0,"Regret going to the theater for this movie. Poorly directed and produced. They made this movie just like a quick blurt to introduce Captain Marvel to the End Game movie next month. The climax of the movie was so poorly built that the climax is barely recognizable. Movie producers need to know that audience come to see a movie to escape reality to a wonderful imaginary world\, not to have political agenda shoving down their throat.

174913,Captain Marvel,2019-03-17,4,"The last half of the film was great and is definitely its strongest part. Carol's developement really is great but could have been better served from a stronger first half. Brie Larson herself was great as Carol when the script let her\, especially the drama driven scenes but gets held back by the\, \""control your emotion\"" aspect of the film. It makes sense in the context of the film but does leave a lot to be desired. The rest of the cast was great and Brie's banter with Samual L Jackson was a welcome edition to the MCU. The hand to hand combat scenes are shot poorly and edited really weird\, making it a less smooth experience however the last act of the film more then makes up for it with its long takes and wide shots. Overall not as strong as other films in the MCU but definitely good. The film holds a lot of potential and makes me eager to see Carol in the larger MCU.",True

I don't know why so many people are adamantly defending this subpar MCU movie.  It was a disappointing origin story. The fx were ok\, but the fight scenes were choppy and jumpy so a bit confusing in what they were trying to do. This editing trick is usually used when the actors are not very well trained. The story was boring with 90s references thrown at you to try and entertain you. The whole movie was actually stolen by a cat. I wished it could have been better but sadly it wasn't...I would rate it along the lines of Thor 2 or Iron man 3. Just not memorable at all.",True

144273,Captain Marvel,2019-03-20,2,It was an entertaining movie but they took alot of creative liberty. The film seemed rush and instead of it being a feminist movie by her just being a bad ass they decided to keep cramming it down our throat. Lots of plot holes as well. Overall they could have done a much better with this movie. Instead ththeththey took a character who has been rebooted several times in the comicsbecause she just isnt a popular character. This also just seemed like a rush to get a female into the mcu and chose a character that no one wanted black widow would have made a much better stand alone movie.,True
106493,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,"A truly enjoyable movie. The nostalgia of the background and music to the lighter side of Fury was wonderfully done. As for Brie Larsen\, an awesome performance and a truly endearing character. Her performance is a must see for young ladies.",True

But the (current) 53% audience score?  Get the %@(# out of here.  I imagine we will discover in short time that studios are manipulating this system to impact each others' bottom line.  Disney ain't going to put up with that $#!z\, yo.\n\nAnyways\, onto a quick and purposefully vague review.\n--------------------------------------------------\nI LOVED it.  Captain Marvel is a good superhero movie\, but it's a GREAT Marvel movie. It manages to set up SHIELD's mission and the Avengers while also setting up the COSMIC aspects of Marvel for \""Phase 4\"".\n\nIn my opinion\, the critics missed the mark on the villain of the story.  The OBVIOUS villain WAS underwhelming and underpowered\, merely the tired old sensei gone bad trope.  However\, the actual villain of the story was much more subtle - it wasn't Yon-Rogg\, the Skrulls\, Ronin\, the Supreme Intelligence\, or the Kree.\n\nBrie Larson is fantastic.  After browsing through critical reviews\, I feel they missed the point.  \""Vers\"" is a amnesiac (brainwashed?) human turned Kree special ops soldier.  As Vers\, Larson shows us the soldier as well as her internal conflict.  As she is comes face to face with this conflict on Earth\, Larson continues to morph into who she is meant to become - Carol Danvers. \n\nCaptain Marvel will return to the screen in just under two months in Avengers:Endgame.  I'm CERTAIN we'll get to see Carol Danvers now that she's truly become a \""noble warrior hero\"".\n\nI can't wait for Brie Larson to lead the charge into the larger Marvel Multiverse.",True

They made Nick Fury an idoit in this film and completley ignored how he actually got his scar. I found Brei Larsons costars to actually out perform her. The movie wasn't terrible it just was one of thoose movies where you just want to turn off your brain because the writing is pretty awful.,True

121212,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,5,"first 10 minutes were a little rough\, and I was worried\, but the rest of the movie was astounding\, inspiring\, hilarious\, and fun! Everything you'd expect from a Marvel movie. Can't wait to see Captain Marvel again in Endgame",True
112189,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,5,Captain Marvel is a great addition to the MCU and this movie answers all the questions that were asked about her since infinity war. Brie Larson does an incredible job and shows another side of heros. ,True
141497,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,2,"It is an insipid film\, which only tries to present who is Captain Marvel.",True

117020,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,"Don’t buy into the false narrative that this show is a bust. While it might not be as good as some of the other Marvel movies\, it was still a solid movie. People need to manage their expectations and just enjoy another good marvel movie. ",True
144633,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,5,It was everything I wanted it to be. The right amount of cheese and great action that I’ve come to expect from a Marvel movie. ,True
125388,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,"Great movie\, especially for an origin story. The end credits scene got me pumped for End Game too. Don’t listen to 80% of the reviews on here. Sooo many losers that have nothing better to do with their miserable lives than crap over this movie and review bomb it when 95% of them haven’t even seen it.",True
193524,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,2,"Was just forced politics and never focused on the movie\, the captain marvel character or the writing. Brie Larson is a good actor but Just doesnâ(TM)t fit this role and it wasnâ(TM)t helpful the the writing throughout the movie was terrible and lacked any interesting or smart dialogues. Marvel should stick to making movies about the movie and not the politics.",True
149163,Captain Marvel,2019-07-23,2,"Lame.   Lacks emotion.  Story line almost completely missing.  Nice uniforms\, and the CGI was decent from time to time\, but that's about it.  Her super power was to use energy to push people away and fly.    Sorry\, I wasted my money.",True

173715,Captain Marvel,2019-03-10,4,"The chemistry between Brie and Samuel L Jackson was definitively the most appealing thing of this movie. An action packed movie\, mixed with some comedy and enternaining moments. Like it a lot. \nI might have been expecting way less with all the bad publicity and comments in social media\, but have to admit that it was a pretty good movie!",True
99983,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"After the brilliance of “Infinity War” “Captain Marvel” feels like a huge step backwards. This is a filler movie\, it actually doesn’t need to exist\, as it’s sole purpose is to to set up Captain Marvel’s arrival in the next Avengers film. It’s a generic origin story poorly told and executed and the worst part is that it’s deathly boring. Brie Larson is a fine actor but in this she delivers her lines with all the charisma of a corpse. It’s like she’s reading them from an auto cue. The plot is a confusing mess of flashbacks\, double crossings and a villain reveal that you see from a mile away. It has no visual style\, everything is shot in a very dull uninspired way\, it feels like a Marvel TV episode and not a feature film. Action scenes are poorly shot with shaky cam where again you can’t see what is happening\, and the sequences in space are nothing you haven’t seen a million times before. The de-aging effects on Samuel L Jackson are amazing and you forget that it’s a special effect. It’s a shame he is is sidelined as the comic relief where he spends most of the time drooling over a ginger cat and making terrible one liners. Still\, everyone in the cinema was laughing at the dreadful jokes so who knows? Roll on “Avengers : End Game” ",True
134378,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"I just watched this film. And yes\, it was underwhelming. I expected more. It is overhyped. The problems in this film: \n1. They made the story of how nick fury lost his eye\, a joke\n2. Carol Danvers being so strong simply by being hit by a battery blast is simply a weak story line\n3. Carol suddenly learning how to fly and her being able to master her powers so quickly was so contrived. There is not even a story behind it. No character development.\nThe cause of this film's problems boils down to story and script. Story writers and directors are at main fault here. Brie Larson and her SJW comments should not be the one to blame.ï»¿",True
144401,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,4,It was a ton of fun with great connections to the other Marvel movies. Special effects were great(especially for SLJ) and I'll definitely see it again!,True
180599,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"Third attempt at giving a review. Not going to type it all out again\, but this movie wasn't that great. Wasn't as bad a Black Panther\, but just couldn't get into it like the other movies in the MCU.I don't see how this ads to the MCU by bringing in this character.",True

178686,Captain Marvel,2019-03-11,1,"There was no story\, the main character had no personality.  The story was very fragmented and no flow or  draw.  The only redeeming parts of the movie were Sam Jackson and his small role in the film.  Other than that you would not see this as a Marvel movie.  If future Marvel movies are like this\, i would be no longer interested in the Marvel Universe.  My wife and kids felt the same way.",True

143263,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,4,It's not the MCU's best but it's another great MCU movie. Brie Larsom and Sam Jackson are fantastic and their chemistry is fenomenal. The problem with this is movie is that it doesnÂ´t anything we haven't seen before and doesn't take any risk.,True
182360,Captain Marvel,2019-03-12,2,"This is not a troll review\, there were elements of the film that I did enjoy overall it just felt like one of \""those\"" films. To clarify what I mean I will make a pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1. Samuel L. Jackson has has some funny moments throughout the film.\n2. Quite a few of the action scenes we're all right.\n3. The first end credit scene was amazing (including Larson's performance)\n4. I went into this hearing that a lot of things were predictable but I found myself surprised by some of the things in the film.\n5. Larson's acting isn't terrible.\n6. Well there were a couple of things that I believe felt forced\, I did I liked",True
186454,Captain Marvel,2019-03-09,2,"This movie was disappointing as the storyline is very lazy and loose even for a superhero movie. The whole movie just felt monotonous\, bland and boring. I was hoping for a better pay off at the end to justify watching this movie but it let me down bitterly. For a superhero movie like this that failed to entertain\, the acting has to be great to make up for it\, sadly only Samuel L Jackson is the only one who gets a pass.",True
109730,Captain Marvel,2019-05-15,2,"Best things about it were Samuel L Jackson\, Stan Lee and the cat.",True
183143,Captain Marvel,2019-03-25,0,"This is the worst movie in the MCU. Brie Larson has no acting ability\, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury was ruined with ridiculous sentiment and the story itself was terrible\, at best. The only saving grace (if there is any) is Ben Mendelsohn and Jude Law's characters. Outstanding performances. How she got her powers\, her \""quirky\"" one liners and pretty much any scene where Larson leads is just awful. My girlfriend fell asleep and I fell enraged. No\, real\, action until the very end. Her overpowered destruction was incredibly lackluster. A terrible movie that doesn't belong in the MCU",True
